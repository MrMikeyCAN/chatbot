my name is <END>
before we proceed any further, hear me speak. <END>
speak, speak. <END>
you are all resolved rather to die than to famish? <END>
resolved. resolved. <END>
first, you know caius marcius is chief enemy to the people. <END>
we know't, we know't. <END>
let us kill him, and we'll have corn at our own price. <END>
is't a verdict? <END>
no more talking on't; let it be done: away, away! <END>
one word, good citizens. <END>
we are accounted poor citizens, the patricians good. <END>
what authority surfeits on would relieve us: if they <END>
would yield us but the superfluity, while it were <END>
wholesome, we might guess they relieved us humanely; <END>
but they think we are too dear: the leanness that <END>
afflicts us, the object of our misery, is as an <END>
inventory to particularise their abundance; our <END>
sufferance is a gain to them let us revenge this with <END>
our pikes, ere we become rakes: for the gods know i <END>
speak this in hunger for bread, not in thirst for revenge. <END>
would you proceed especially against caius marcius? <END>
against him first: he's a very dog to the commonalty. <END>
consider you what services he has done for his country? <END>
very well; and could be content to give him good <END>
report fort, but that he pays himself with being proud. <END>
nay, but speak not maliciously. <END>
i say unto you, what he hath done famously, he did <END>
it to that end: though soft-conscienced men can be <END>
content to say it was for his country he did it to <END>
please his mother and to be partly proud; which he <END>
is, even till the altitude of his virtue. <END>
what he cannot help in his nature, you account a <END>
vice in him. you must in no way say he is covetous. <END>
if i must not, i need not be barren of accusations; <END>
he hath faults, with surplus, to tire in repetition. <END>
what shouts are these? the other side o' the city <END>
is risen: why stay we prating here? to the capitol! <END>
come, come. <END>
soft! who comes here? <END>
worthy menenius agrippa; one that hath always loved <END>
the people. <END>
he's one honest enough: would all the rest were so! <END>
what work's, my countrymen, in hand? where go you <END>
with bats and clubs? the matter? speak, i pray you. <END>
our business is not unknown to the senate; they have <END>
had inkling this fortnight what we intend to do, <END>
which now we'll show 'em in deeds. they say poor <END>
suitors have strong breaths: they shall know we <END>
have strong arms too. <END>
why, masters, my good friends, mine honest neighbours, <END>
will you undo yourselves? <END>
we cannot, sir, we are undone already. <END>
i tell you, friends, most charitable care <END>
have the patricians of you. for your wants, <END>
your suffering in this dearth, you may as well <END>
strike at the heaven with your staves as lift them <END>
against the roman state, whose course will on <END>
the way it takes, cracking ten thousand curbs <END>
of more strong link asunder than can ever <END>
appear in your impediment. for the dearth, <END>
the gods, not the patricians, make it, and <END>
your knees to them, not arms, must help. alack, <END>
you are transported by calamity <END>
thither where more attends you, and you slander <END>
the helms o' the state, who care for you like fathers, <END>
when you curse them as enemies. <END>
care for us! true, indeed! they ne'er cared for us <END>
yet: suffer us to famish, and their store-houses <END>
crammed with grain; make edicts for usury, to <END>
support usurers; repeal daily any wholesome act <END>
established against the rich, and provide more <END>
piercing statutes daily, to chain up and restrain <END>
the poor. if the wars eat us not up, they will; and <END>
there's all the love they bear us. <END>
either you must <END>
confess yourselves wondrous malicious, <END>
or be accused of folly. i shall tell you <END>
a pretty tale: it may be you have heard it; <END>
but, since it serves my purpose, i will venture <END>
to stale 't a little more. <END>
well, i'll hear it, sir: yet you must not think to <END>
fob off our disgrace with a tale: but, an 't please <END>
you, deliver. <END>
there was a time when all the body's members <END>
rebell'd against the belly, thus accused it: <END>
that only like a gulf it did remain <END>
i' the midst o' the body, idle and unactive, <END>
still cupboarding the viand, never bearing <END>
like labour with the rest, where the other instruments <END>
did see and hear, devise, instruct, walk, feel, <END>
and, mutually participate, did minister <END>
unto the appetite and affection common <END>
of the whole body. the belly answer'd-- <END>
well, sir, what answer made the belly? <END>
sir, i shall tell you. with a kind of smile, <END>
which ne'er came from the lungs, but even thus-- <END>
for, look you, i may make the belly smile <END>
as well as speak--it tauntingly replied <END>
to the discontented members, the mutinous parts <END>
that envied his receipt; even so most fitly <END>
as you malign our senators for that <END>
they are not such as you. <END>
your belly's answer? what! <END>
the kingly-crowned head, the vigilant eye, <END>
the counsellor heart, the arm our soldier, <END>
our steed the leg, the tongue our trumpeter. <END>
with other muniments and petty helps <END>
in this our fabric, if that they-- <END>
what then? <END>
'fore me, this fellow speaks! what then? what then? <END>
should by the cormorant belly be restrain'd, <END>
who is the sink o' the body,-- <END>
well, what then? <END>
the former agents, if they did complain, <END>
what could the belly answer? <END>
i will tell you <END>
if you'll bestow a small--of what you have little-- <END>
patience awhile, you'll hear the belly's answer. <END>
ye're long about it. <END>
note me this, good friend; <END>
your most grave belly was deliberate, <END>
not rash like his accusers, and thus answer'd: <END>
'true is it, my incorporate friends,' quoth he, <END>
'that i receive the general food at first, <END>
which you do live upon; and fit it is, <END>
because i am the store-house and the shop <END>
of the whole body: but, if you do remember, <END>
i send it through the rivers of your blood, <END>
even to the court, the heart, to the seat o' the brain; <END>
and, through the cranks and offices of man, <END>
the strongest nerves and small inferior veins <END>
from me receive that natural competency <END>
whereby they live: and though that all at once, <END>
you, my good friends,'--this says the belly, mark me,-- <END>
ay, sir; well, well. <END>
'though all at once cannot <END>
see what i do deliver out to each, <END>
yet i can make my audit up, that all <END>
from me do back receive the flour of all, <END>
and leave me but the bran.' what say you to't? <END>
it was an answer: how apply you this? <END>
the senators of rome are this good belly, <END>
and you the mutinous members; for examine <END>
their counsels and their cares, digest things rightly <END>
touching the weal o' the common, you shall find <END>
no public benefit which you receive <END>
but it proceeds or comes from them to you <END>
and no way from yourselves. what do you think, <END>
you, the great toe of this assembly? <END>
i the great toe! why the great toe? <END>
for that, being one o' the lowest, basest, poorest, <END>
of this most wise rebellion, thou go'st foremost: <END>
thou rascal, that art worst in blood to run, <END>
lead'st first to win some vantage. <END>
but make you ready your stiff bats and clubs: <END>
rome and her rats are at the point of battle; <END>
the one side must have bale. <END>
hail, noble marcius! <END>
thanks. what's the matter, you dissentious rogues, <END>
that, rubbing the poor itch of your opinion, <END>
make yourselves scabs? <END>
we have ever your good word. <END>
he that will give good words to thee will flatter <END>
beneath abhorring. what would you have, you curs, <END>
that like nor peace nor war? the one affrights you, <END>
the other makes you proud. he that trusts to you, <END>
where he should find you lions, finds you hares; <END>
where foxes, geese: you are no surer, no, <END>
than is the coal of fire upon the ice, <END>
or hailstone in the sun. your virtue is <END>
to make him worthy whose offence subdues him <END>
and curse that justice did it. <END>
who deserves greatness <END>
deserves your hate; and your affections are <END>
a sick man's appetite, who desires most that <END>
which would increase his evil. he that depends <END>
upon your favours swims with fins of lead <END>
and hews down oaks with rushes. hang ye! trust ye? <END>
with every minute you do change a mind, <END>
and call him noble that was now your hate, <END>
him vile that was your garland. what's the matter, <END>
that in these several places of the city <END>
you cry against the noble senate, who, <END>
under the gods, keep you in awe, which else <END>
would feed on one another? what's their seeking? <END>
for corn at their own rates; whereof, they say, <END>
the city is well stored. <END>
hang 'em! they say! <END>
they'll sit by the fire, and presume to know <END>
what's done i' the capitol; who's like to rise, <END>
who thrives and who declines; side factions <END>
and give out <END>
conjectural marriages; making parties strong <END>
and feebling such as stand not in their liking <END>
below their cobbled shoes. they say there's <END>
grain enough! <END>
would the nobility lay aside their ruth, <END>
and let me use my sword, i'll make a quarry <END>
with thousands of these quarter'd slaves, as high <END>
as i could pick my lance. <END>
nay, these are almost thoroughly persuaded; <END>
for though abundantly they lack discretion, <END>
yet are they passing cowardly. but, i beseech you, <END>
what says the other troop? <END>
they are dissolved: hang 'em! <END>
they said they were an-hungry; sigh'd forth proverbs, <END>
that hunger broke stone walls, that dogs must eat, <END>
that meat was made for mouths, that the gods sent not <END>
corn for the rich men only: with these shreds <END>
they vented their complainings; which being answer'd, <END>
and a petition granted them, a strange one-- <END>
to break the heart of generosity, <END>
and make bold power look pale--they threw their caps <END>
as they would hang them on the horns o' the moon, <END>
shouting their emulation. <END>
what is granted them? <END>
five tribunes to defend their vulgar wisdoms, <END>
of their own choice: one's junius brutus, <END>
sicinius velutus, and i know not--'sdeath! <END>
the rabble should have first unroof'd the city, <END>
ere so prevail'd with me: it will in time <END>
win upon power and throw forth greater themes <END>
for insurrection's arguing. <END>
this is strange. <END>
go, get you home, you fragments! <END>
where's caius marcius? <END>
the news is, sir, the volsces are in arms. <END>
i am glad on 't: then we shall ha' means to vent <END>
our musty superfluity. see, our best elders. <END>
marcius, 'tis true that you have lately told us; <END>
the volsces are in arms. <END>
they have a leader, <END>
tullus aufidius, that will put you to 't. <END>
i sin in envying his nobility, <END>
and were i any thing but what i am, <END>
i would wish me only he. <END>
you have fought together. <END>
were half to half the world by the ears and he. <END>
upon my party, i'ld revolt to make <END>
only my wars with him: he is a lion <END>
that i am proud to hunt. <END>
then, worthy marcius, <END>
attend upon cominius to these wars. <END>
it is your former promise. <END>
sir, it is; <END>
and i am constant. titus lartius, thou <END>
shalt see me once more strike at tullus' face. <END>
what, art thou stiff? stand'st out? <END>
no, caius marcius; <END>
i'll lean upon one crutch and fight with t'other, <END>
ere stay behind this business. <END>
o, true-bred! <END>
your company to the capitol; where, i know, <END>
our greatest friends attend us. <END>
noble marcius! <END>
nay, let them follow: <END>
the volsces have much corn; take these rats thither <END>
to gnaw their garners. worshipful mutiners, <END>
your valour puts well forth: pray, follow. <END>
was ever man so proud as is this marcius? <END>
he has no equal. <END>
when we were chosen tribunes for the people,-- <END>
mark'd you his lip and eyes? <END>
nay. but his taunts. <END>
being moved, he will not spare to gird the gods. <END>
be-mock the modest moon. <END>
the present wars devour him: he is grown <END>
too proud to be so valiant. <END>
such a nature, <END>
tickled with good success, disdains the shadow <END>
which he treads on at noon: but i do wonder <END>
his insolence can brook to be commanded <END>
under cominius. <END>
fame, at the which he aims, <END>
in whom already he's well graced, can not <END>
better be held nor more attain'd than by <END>
a place below the first: for what miscarries <END>
shall be the general's fault, though he perform <END>
to the utmost of a man, and giddy censure <END>
will then cry out of marcius 'o if he <END>
had borne the business!' <END>
besides, if things go well, <END>
opinion that so sticks on marcius shall <END>
of his demerits rob cominius. <END>
half all cominius' honours are to marcius. <END>
though marcius earned them not, and all his faults <END>
to marcius shall be honours, though indeed <END>
in aught he merit not. <END>
let's hence, and hear <END>
how the dispatch is made, and in what fashion, <END>
more than his singularity, he goes <END>
upon this present action. <END>
lets along. <END>
so, your opinion is, aufidius, <END>
that they of rome are entered in our counsels <END>
and know how we proceed. <END>
is it not yours? <END>
what ever have been thought on in this state, <END>
that could be brought to bodily act ere rome <END>
had circumvention? 'tis not four days gone <END>
since i heard thence; these are the words: i think <END>
i have the letter here; yes, here it is. <END>
'they have press'd a power, but it is not known <END>
whether for east or west: the dearth is great; <END>
the people mutinous; and it is rumour'd, <END>
cominius, marcius your old enemy, <END>
who is of rome worse hated than of you, <END>
and titus lartius, a most valiant roman, <END>
these three lead on this preparation <END>
whither 'tis bent: most likely 'tis for you: <END>
consider of it.' <END>
our army's in the field <END>
we never yet made doubt but rome was ready <END>
to answer us. <END>
nor did you think it folly <END>
to keep your great pretences veil'd till when <END>
they needs must show themselves; which <END>
in the hatching, <END>
it seem'd, appear'd to rome. by the discovery. <END>
we shall be shorten'd in our aim, which was <END>
to take in many towns ere almost rome <END>
should know we were afoot. <END>
noble aufidius, <END>
take your commission; hie you to your bands: <END>
let us alone to guard corioli: <END>
if they set down before 's, for the remove <END>
bring your army; but, i think, you'll find <END>
they've not prepared for us. <END>
o, doubt not that; <END>
i speak from certainties. nay, more, <END>
some parcels of their power are forth already, <END>
and only hitherward. i leave your honours. <END>
if we and caius marcius chance to meet, <END>
'tis sworn between us we shall ever strike <END>
till one can do no more. <END>
the gods assist you! <END>
and keep your honours safe! <END>
farewell. <END>
farewell. <END>
farewell. <END>
i pray you, daughter, sing; or express yourself in a <END>
more comfortable sort: if my son were my husband, i <END>
should freelier rejoice in that absence wherein he <END>
won honour than in the embracements of his bed where <END>
he would show most love. when yet he was but <END>
tender-bodied and the only son of my womb, when <END>
youth with comeliness plucked all gaze his way, when <END>
for a day of kings' entreaties a mother should not <END>
sell him an hour from her beholding, i, considering <END>
how honour would become such a person. that it was <END>
no better than picture-like to hang by the wall, if <END>
renown made it not stir, was pleased to let him seek <END>
danger where he was like to find fame. to a cruel <END>
war i sent him; from whence he returned, his brows <END>
bound with oak. i tell thee, daughter, i sprang not <END>
more in joy at first hearing he was a man-child <END>
than now in first seeing he had proved himself a <END>
man. <END>
but had he died in the business, madam; how then? <END>
then his good report should have been my son; i <END>
therein would have found issue. hear me profess <END>
sincerely: had i a dozen sons, each in my love <END>
alike and none less dear than thine and my good <END>
marcius, i had rather had eleven die nobly for their <END>
country than one voluptuously surfeit out of action. <END>
madam, the lady valeria is come to visit you. <END>
beseech you, give me leave to retire myself. <END>
indeed, you shall not. <END>
methinks i hear hither your husband's drum, <END>
see him pluck aufidius down by the hair, <END>
as children from a bear, the volsces shunning him: <END>
methinks i see him stamp thus, and call thus: <END>
'come on, you cowards! you were got in fear, <END>
though you were born in rome:' his bloody brow <END>
with his mail'd hand then wiping, forth he goes, <END>
like to a harvest-man that's task'd to mow <END>
or all or lose his hire. <END>
his bloody brow! o jupiter, no blood! <END>
away, you fool! it more becomes a man <END>
than gilt his trophy: the breasts of hecuba, <END>
when she did suckle hector, look'd not lovelier <END>
than hector's forehead when it spit forth blood <END>
at grecian sword, contemning. tell valeria, <END>
we are fit to bid her welcome. <END>
heavens bless my lord from fell aufidius! <END>
he'll beat aufidius 'head below his knee <END>
and tread upon his neck. <END>
my ladies both, good day to you. <END>
sweet madam. <END>
i am glad to see your ladyship. <END>
how do you both? you are manifest house-keepers. <END>
what are you sewing here? a fine spot, in good <END>
faith. how does your little son? <END>
i thank your ladyship; well, good madam. <END>
he had rather see the swords, and hear a drum, than <END>
look upon his school-master. <END>
o' my word, the father's son: i'll swear,'tis a <END>
very pretty boy. o' my troth, i looked upon him o' <END>
wednesday half an hour together: has such a <END>
confirmed countenance. i saw him run after a gilded <END>
butterfly: and when he caught it, he let it go <END>
again; and after it again; and over and over he <END>
comes, and again; catched it again; or whether his <END>
fall enraged him, or how 'twas, he did so set his <END>
teeth and tear it; o, i warrant it, how he mammocked <END>
it! <END>
one on 's father's moods. <END>
indeed, la, 'tis a noble child. <END>
a crack, madam. <END>
come, lay aside your stitchery; i must have you play <END>
the idle husewife with me this afternoon. <END>
no, good madam; i will not out of doors. <END>
not out of doors! <END>
she shall, she shall. <END>
indeed, no, by your patience; i'll not over the <END>
threshold till my lord return from the wars. <END>
fie, you confine yourself most unreasonably: come, <END>
you must go visit the good lady that lies in. <END>
i will wish her speedy strength, and visit her with <END>
my prayers; but i cannot go thither. <END>
why, i pray you? <END>
'tis not to save labour, nor that i want love. <END>
you would be another penelope: yet, they say, all <END>
the yarn she spun in ulysses' absence did but fill <END>
ithaca full of moths. come; i would your cambric <END>
were sensible as your finger, that you might leave <END>
pricking it for pity. come, you shall go with us. <END>
no, good madam, pardon me; indeed, i will not forth. <END>
in truth, la, go with me; and i'll tell you <END>
excellent news of your husband. <END>
o, good madam, there can be none yet. <END>
verily, i do not jest with you; there came news from <END>
him last night. <END>
indeed, madam? <END>
in earnest, it's true; i heard a senator speak it. <END>
thus it is: the volsces have an army forth; against <END>
whom cominius the general is gone, with one part of <END>
our roman power: your lord and titus lartius are set <END>
down before their city corioli; they nothing doubt <END>
prevailing and to make it brief wars. this is true, <END>
on mine honour; and so, i pray, go with us. <END>
give me excuse, good madam; i will obey you in every <END>
thing hereafter. <END>
let her alone, lady: as she is now, she will but <END>
disease our better mirth. <END>
in troth, i think she would. fare you well, then. <END>
come, good sweet lady. prithee, virgilia, turn thy <END>
solemness out o' door. and go along with us. <END>
no, at a word, madam; indeed, i must not. i wish <END>
you much mirth. <END>
well, then, farewell. <END>
yonder comes news. a wager they have met. <END>
my horse to yours, no. <END>
'tis done. <END>
agreed. <END>
say, has our general met the enemy? <END>
they lie in view; but have not spoke as yet. <END>
so, the good horse is mine. <END>
i'll buy him of you. <END>
no, i'll nor sell nor give him: lend you him i will <END>
for half a hundred years. summon the town. <END>
how far off lie these armies? <END>
within this mile and half. <END>
then shall we hear their 'larum, and they ours. <END>
now, mars, i prithee, make us quick in work, <END>
that we with smoking swords may march from hence, <END>
to help our fielded friends! come, blow thy blast. <END>
tutus aufidius, is he within your walls? <END>
no, nor a man that fears you less than he, <END>
that's lesser than a little. <END>
hark! our drums <END>
are bringing forth our youth. we'll break our walls, <END>
rather than they shall pound us up: our gates, <END>
which yet seem shut, we, have but pinn'd with rushes; <END>
they'll open of themselves. <END>
hark you. far off! <END>
there is aufidius; list, what work he makes <END>
amongst your cloven army. <END>
o, they are at it! <END>
their noise be our instruction. ladders, ho! <END>
they fear us not, but issue forth their city. <END>
now put your shields before your hearts, and fight <END>
with hearts more proof than shields. advance, <END>
brave titus: <END>
they do disdain us much beyond our thoughts, <END>
which makes me sweat with wrath. come on, my fellows: <END>
he that retires i'll take him for a volsce, <END>
and he shall feel mine edge. <END>
all the contagion of the south light on you, <END>
you shames of rome! you herd of--boils and plagues <END>
plaster you o'er, that you may be abhorr'd <END>
further than seen and one infect another <END>
against the wind a mile! you souls of geese, <END>
that bear the shapes of men, how have you run <END>
from slaves that apes would beat! pluto and hell! <END>
all hurt behind; backs red, and faces pale <END>
with flight and agued fear! mend and charge home, <END>
or, by the fires of heaven, i'll leave the foe <END>
and make my wars on you: look to't: come on; <END>
if you'll stand fast, we'll beat them to their wives, <END>
as they us to our trenches followed. <END>
so, now the gates are ope: now prove good seconds: <END>
'tis for the followers fortune widens them, <END>
not for the fliers: mark me, and do the like. <END>
fool-hardiness; not i. <END>
nor i. <END>
see, they have shut him in. <END>
to the pot, i warrant him. <END>
what is become of marcius? <END>
slain, sir, doubtless. <END>
following the fliers at the very heels, <END>
with them he enters; who, upon the sudden, <END>
clapp'd to their gates: he is himself alone, <END>
to answer all the city. <END>
o noble fellow! <END>
who sensibly outdares his senseless sword, <END>
and, when it bows, stands up. thou art left, marcius: <END>
a carbuncle entire, as big as thou art, <END>
were not so rich a jewel. thou wast a soldier <END>
even to cato's wish, not fierce and terrible <END>
only in strokes; but, with thy grim looks and <END>
the thunder-like percussion of thy sounds, <END>
thou madst thine enemies shake, as if the world <END>
were feverous and did tremble. <END>
look, sir. <END>
o,'tis marcius! <END>
let's fetch him off, or make remain alike. <END>
this will i carry to rome. <END>
and i this. <END>
a murrain on't! i took this for silver. <END>
see here these movers that do prize their hours <END>
at a crack'd drachm! cushions, leaden spoons, <END>
irons of a doit, doublets that hangmen would <END>
bury with those that wore them, these base slaves, <END>
ere yet the fight be done, pack up: down with them! <END>
and hark, what noise the general makes! to him! <END>
there is the man of my soul's hate, aufidius, <END>
piercing our romans: then, valiant titus, take <END>
convenient numbers to make good the city; <END>
whilst i, with those that have the spirit, will haste <END>
to help cominius. <END>
worthy sir, thou bleed'st; <END>
thy exercise hath been too violent for <END>
a second course of fight. <END>
sir, praise me not; <END>
my work hath yet not warm'd me: fare you well: <END>
the blood i drop is rather physical <END>
than dangerous to me: to aufidius thus <END>
i will appear, and fight. <END>
now the fair goddess, fortune, <END>
fall deep in love with thee; and her great charms <END>
misguide thy opposers' swords! bold gentleman, <END>
prosperity be thy page! <END>
thy friend no less <END>
than those she placeth highest! so, farewell. <END>
thou worthiest marcius! <END>
go, sound thy trumpet in the market-place; <END>
call thither all the officers o' the town, <END>
where they shall know our mind: away! <END>
breathe you, my friends: well fought; <END>
we are come off <END>
like romans, neither foolish in our stands, <END>
nor cowardly in retire: believe me, sirs, <END>
we shall be charged again. whiles we have struck, <END>
by interims and conveying gusts we have heard <END>
the charges of our friends. ye roman gods! <END>
lead their successes as we wish our own, <END>
that both our powers, with smiling <END>
fronts encountering, <END>
may give you thankful sacrifice. <END>
thy news? <END>
the citizens of corioli have issued, <END>
and given to lartius and to marcius battle: <END>
i saw our party to their trenches driven, <END>
and then i came away. <END>
though thou speak'st truth, <END>
methinks thou speak'st not well. <END>
how long is't since? <END>
above an hour, my lord. <END>
'tis not a mile; briefly we heard their drums: <END>
how couldst thou in a mile confound an hour, <END>
and bring thy news so late? <END>
spies of the volsces <END>
held me in chase, that i was forced to wheel <END>
three or four miles about, else had i, sir, <END>
half an hour since brought my report. <END>
who's yonder, <END>
that does appear as he were flay'd? o gods <END>
he has the stamp of marcius; and i have <END>
before-time seen him thus. <END>
the shepherd knows not thunder from a tabour <END>
more than i know the sound of marcius' tongue <END>
from every meaner man. <END>
come i too late? <END>
ay, if you come not in the blood of others, <END>
but mantled in your own. <END>
o, let me clip ye <END>
in arms as sound as when i woo'd, in heart <END>
as merry as when our nuptial day was done, <END>
and tapers burn'd to bedward! <END>
flower of warriors, <END>
how is it with titus lartius? <END>
as with a man busied about decrees: <END>
condemning some to death, and some to exile; <END>
ransoming him, or pitying, threatening the other; <END>
holding corioli in the name of rome, <END>
even like a fawning greyhound in the leash, <END>
to let him slip at will. <END>
where is that slave <END>
which told me they had beat you to your trenches? <END>
where is he? call him hither. <END>
let him alone; <END>
he did inform the truth: but for our gentlemen, <END>
the common file--a plague! tribunes for them!-- <END>
the mouse ne'er shunn'd the cat as they did budge <END>
from rascals worse than they. <END>
but how prevail'd you? <END>
will the time serve to tell? i do not think. <END>
where is the enemy? are you lords o' the field? <END>
if not, why cease you till you are so? <END>
marcius, <END>
we have at disadvantage fought and did <END>
retire to win our purpose. <END>
how lies their battle? know you on which side <END>
they have placed their men of trust? <END>
as i guess, marcius, <END>
their bands i' the vaward are the antiates, <END>
of their best trust; o'er them aufidius, <END>
their very heart of hope. <END>
i do beseech you, <END>
by all the battles wherein we have fought, <END>
by the blood we have shed together, by the vows <END>
we have made to endure friends, that you directly <END>
set me against aufidius and his antiates; <END>
and that you not delay the present, but, <END>
filling the air with swords advanced and darts, <END>
we prove this very hour. <END>
though i could wish <END>
you were conducted to a gentle bath <END>
and balms applied to, you, yet dare i never <END>
deny your asking: take your choice of those <END>
that best can aid your action. <END>
those are they <END>
that most are willing. if any such be here-- <END>
as it were sin to doubt--that love this painting <END>
wherein you see me smear'd; if any fear <END>
lesser his person than an ill report; <END>
if any think brave death outweighs bad life <END>
and that his country's dearer than himself; <END>
let him alone, or so many so minded, <END>
wave thus, to express his disposition, <END>
and follow marcius. <END>
o, me alone! make you a sword of me? <END>
if these shows be not outward, which of you <END>
but is four volsces? none of you but is <END>
able to bear against the great aufidius <END>
a shield as hard as his. a certain number, <END>
though thanks to all, must i select <END>
from all: the rest <END>
shall bear the business in some other fight, <END>
as cause will be obey'd. please you to march; <END>
and four shall quickly draw out my command, <END>
which men are best inclined. <END>
march on, my fellows: <END>
make good this ostentation, and you shall <END>
divide in all with us. <END>
so, let the ports be guarded: keep your duties, <END>
as i have set them down. if i do send, dispatch <END>
those centuries to our aid: the rest will serve <END>
for a short holding: if we lose the field, <END>
we cannot keep the town. <END>
fear not our care, sir. <END>
hence, and shut your gates upon's. <END>
our guider, come; to the roman camp conduct us. <END>
i'll fight with none but thee; for i do hate thee <END>
worse than a promise-breaker. <END>
we hate alike: <END>
not afric owns a serpent i abhor <END>
more than thy fame and envy. fix thy foot. <END>
let the first budger die the other's slave, <END>
and the gods doom him after! <END>
if i fly, marcius, <END>
holloa me like a hare. <END>
within these three hours, tullus, <END>
alone i fought in your corioli walls, <END>
and made what work i pleased: 'tis not my blood <END>
wherein thou seest me mask'd; for thy revenge <END>
wrench up thy power to the highest. <END>
wert thou the hector <END>
that was the whip of your bragg'd progeny, <END>
thou shouldst not scape me here. <END>
officious, and not valiant, you have shamed me <END>
in your condemned seconds. <END>
if i should tell thee o'er this thy day's work, <END>
thou'ldst not believe thy deeds: but i'll report it <END>
where senators shall mingle tears with smiles, <END>
where great patricians shall attend and shrug, <END>
i' the end admire, where ladies shall be frighted, <END>
and, gladly quaked, hear more; where the <END>
dull tribunes, <END>
that, with the fusty plebeians, hate thine honours, <END>
shall say against their hearts 'we thank the gods <END>
our rome hath such a soldier.' <END>
yet camest thou to a morsel of this feast, <END>
having fully dined before. <END>
o general, <END>
here is the steed, we the caparison: <END>
hadst thou beheld-- <END>
pray now, no more: my mother, <END>
who has a charter to extol her blood, <END>
when she does praise me grieves me. i have done <END>
as you have done; that's what i can; induced <END>
as you have been; that's for my country: <END>
he that has but effected his good will <END>
hath overta'en mine act. <END>
you shall not be <END>
the grave of your deserving; rome must know <END>
the value of her own: 'twere a concealment <END>
worse than a theft, no less than a traducement, <END>
to hide your doings; and to silence that, <END>
which, to the spire and top of praises vouch'd, <END>
would seem but modest: therefore, i beseech you <END>
in sign of what you are, not to reward <END>
what you have done--before our army hear me. <END>
i have some wounds upon me, and they smart <END>
to hear themselves remember'd. <END>
should they not, <END>
well might they fester 'gainst ingratitude, <END>
and tent themselves with death. of all the horses, <END>
whereof we have ta'en good and good store, of all <END>
the treasure in this field achieved and city, <END>
we render you the tenth, to be ta'en forth, <END>
before the common distribution, at <END>
your only choice. <END>
i thank you, general; <END>
but cannot make my heart consent to take <END>
a bribe to pay my sword: i do refuse it; <END>
and stand upon my common part with those <END>
that have beheld the doing. <END>
may these same instruments, which you profane, <END>
never sound more! when drums and trumpets shall <END>
i' the field prove flatterers, let courts and cities be <END>
made all of false-faced soothing! <END>
when steel grows soft as the parasite's silk, <END>
let him be made a coverture for the wars! <END>
no more, i say! for that i have not wash'd <END>
my nose that bled, or foil'd some debile wretch.-- <END>
which, without note, here's many else have done,-- <END>
you shout me forth <END>
in acclamations hyperbolical; <END>
as if i loved my little should be dieted <END>
in praises sauced with lies. <END>
too modest are you; <END>
more cruel to your good report than grateful <END>
to us that give you truly: by your patience, <END>
if 'gainst yourself you be incensed, we'll put you, <END>
like one that means his proper harm, in manacles, <END>
then reason safely with you. therefore, be it known, <END>
as to us, to all the world, that caius marcius <END>
wears this war's garland: in token of the which, <END>
my noble steed, known to the camp, i give him, <END>
with all his trim belonging; and from this time, <END>
for what he did before corioli, call him, <END>
with all the applause and clamour of the host, <END>
caius marcius coriolanus! bear <END>
the addition nobly ever! <END>
caius marcius coriolanus! <END>
i will go wash; <END>
and when my face is fair, you shall perceive <END>
whether i blush or no: howbeit, i thank you. <END>
i mean to stride your steed, and at all times <END>
to undercrest your good addition <END>
to the fairness of my power. <END>
so, to our tent; <END>
where, ere we do repose us, we will write <END>
to rome of our success. you, titus lartius, <END>
must to corioli back: send us to rome <END>
the best, with whom we may articulate, <END>
for their own good and ours. <END>
i shall, my lord. <END>
the gods begin to mock me. i, that now <END>
refused most princely gifts, am bound to beg <END>
of my lord general. <END>
take't; 'tis yours. what is't? <END>
i sometime lay here in corioli <END>
at a poor man's house; he used me kindly: <END>
he cried to me; i saw him prisoner; <END>
but then aufidius was within my view, <END>
and wrath o'erwhelm'd my pity: i request you <END>
to give my poor host freedom. <END>
o, well begg'd! <END>
were he the butcher of my son, he should <END>
be free as is the wind. deliver him, titus. <END>
marcius, his name? <END>
by jupiter! forgot. <END>
i am weary; yea, my memory is tired. <END>
have we no wine here? <END>
go we to our tent: <END>
the blood upon your visage dries; 'tis time <END>
it should be look'd to: come. <END>
the town is ta'en! <END>
'twill be deliver'd back on good condition. <END>
condition! <END>
i would i were a roman; for i cannot, <END>
being a volsce, be that i am. condition! <END>
what good condition can a treaty find <END>
i' the part that is at mercy? five times, marcius, <END>
i have fought with thee: so often hast thou beat me, <END>
and wouldst do so, i think, should we encounter <END>
as often as we eat. by the elements, <END>
if e'er again i meet him beard to beard, <END>
he's mine, or i am his: mine emulation <END>
hath not that honour in't it had; for where <END>
i thought to crush him in an equal force, <END>
true sword to sword, i'll potch at him some way <END>
or wrath or craft may get him. <END>
he's the devil. <END>
bolder, though not so subtle. my valour's poison'd <END>
with only suffering stain by him; for him <END>
shall fly out of itself: nor sleep nor sanctuary, <END>
being naked, sick, nor fane nor capitol, <END>
the prayers of priests nor times of sacrifice, <END>
embarquements all of fury, shall lift up <END>
their rotten privilege and custom 'gainst <END>
my hate to marcius: where i find him, were it <END>
at home, upon my brother's guard, even there, <END>
against the hospitable canon, would i <END>
wash my fierce hand in's heart. go you to the city; <END>
learn how 'tis held; and what they are that must <END>
be hostages for rome. <END>
will not you go? <END>
i am attended at the cypress grove: i pray you-- <END>
'tis south the city mills--bring me word thither <END>
how the world goes, that to the pace of it <END>
i may spur on my journey. <END>
i shall, sir. <END>
the augurer tells me we shall have news to-night. <END>
good or bad? <END>
not according to the prayer of the people, for they <END>
love not marcius. <END>
nature teaches beasts to know their friends. <END>
pray you, who does the wolf love? <END>
the lamb. <END>
ay, to devour him; as the hungry plebeians would the <END>
noble marcius. <END>
he's a lamb indeed, that baes like a bear. <END>
he's a bear indeed, that lives like a lamb. you two <END>
are old men: tell me one thing that i shall ask you. <END>
well, sir. <END>
in what enormity is marcius poor in, that you two <END>
have not in abundance? <END>
he's poor in no one fault, but stored with all. <END>
especially in pride. <END>
and topping all others in boasting. <END>
this is strange now: do you two know how you are <END>
censured here in the city, i mean of us o' the <END>
right-hand file? do you? <END>
why, how are we censured? <END>
because you talk of pride now,--will you not be angry? <END>
well, well, sir, well. <END>
why, 'tis no great matter; for a very little thief of <END>
occasion will rob you of a great deal of patience: <END>
give your dispositions the reins, and be angry at <END>
your pleasures; at the least if you take it as a <END>
pleasure to you in being so. you blame marcius for <END>
being proud? <END>
we do it not alone, sir. <END>
i know you can do very little alone; for your helps <END>
are many, or else your actions would grow wondrous <END>
single: your abilities are too infant-like for <END>
doing much alone. you talk of pride: o that you <END>
could turn your eyes toward the napes of your necks, <END>
and make but an interior survey of your good selves! <END>
o that you could! <END>
what then, sir? <END>
why, then you should discover a brace of unmeriting, <END>
proud, violent, testy magistrates, alias fools, as <END>
any in rome. <END>
menenius, you are known well enough too. <END>
i am known to be a humorous patrician, and one that <END>
loves a cup of hot wine with not a drop of allaying <END>
tiber in't; said to be something imperfect in <END>
favouring the first complaint; hasty and tinder-like <END>
upon too trivial motion; one that converses more <END>
with the buttock of the night than with the forehead <END>
of the morning: what i think i utter, and spend my <END>
malice in my breath. meeting two such wealsmen as <END>
you are--i cannot call you lycurguses--if the drink <END>
you give me touch my palate adversely, i make a <END>
crooked face at it. i can't say your worships have <END>
delivered the matter well, when i find the ass in <END>
compound with the major part of your syllables: and <END>
though i must be content to bear with those that say <END>
you are reverend grave men, yet they lie deadly that <END>
tell you you have good faces. if you see this in <END>
the map of my microcosm, follows it that i am known <END>
well enough too? what barm can your bisson <END>
conspectuities glean out of this character, if i be <END>
known well enough too? <END>
come, sir, come, we know you well enough. <END>
you know neither me, yourselves nor any thing. you <END>
are ambitious for poor knaves' caps and legs: you <END>
wear out a good wholesome forenoon in hearing a <END>
cause between an orange wife and a fosset-seller; <END>
and then rejourn the controversy of three pence to a <END>
second day of audience. when you are hearing a <END>
matter between party and party, if you chance to be <END>
pinched with the colic, you make faces like <END>
mummers; set up the bloody flag against all <END>
patience; and, in roaring for a chamber-pot, <END>
dismiss the controversy bleeding the more entangled <END>
by your hearing: all the peace you make in their <END>
cause is, calling both the parties knaves. you are <END>
a pair of strange ones. <END>
come, come, you are well understood to be a <END>
perfecter giber for the table than a necessary <END>
bencher in the capitol. <END>
our very priests must become mockers, if they shall <END>
encounter such ridiculous subjects as you are. when <END>
you speak best unto the purpose, it is not worth the <END>
wagging of your beards; and your beards deserve not <END>
so honourable a grave as to stuff a botcher's <END>
cushion, or to be entombed in an ass's pack- <END>
saddle. yet you must be saying, marcius is proud; <END>
who in a cheap estimation, is worth predecessors <END>
since deucalion, though peradventure some of the <END>
best of 'em were hereditary hangmen. god-den to <END>
your worships: more of your conversation would <END>
infect my brain, being the herdsmen of the beastly <END>
plebeians: i will be bold to take my leave of you. <END>
how now, my as fair as noble ladies,--and the moon, <END>
were she earthly, no nobler,--whither do you follow <END>
your eyes so fast? <END>
honourable menenius, my boy marcius approaches; for <END>
the love of juno, let's go. <END>
ha! marcius coming home! <END>
ay, worthy menenius; and with most prosperous <END>
approbation. <END>
take my cap, jupiter, and i thank thee. hoo! <END>
marcius coming home! <END>
nay,'tis true. <END>
look, here's a letter from him: the state hath <END>
another, his wife another; and, i think, there's one <END>
at home for you. <END>
i will make my very house reel tonight: a letter for <END>
me! <END>
yes, certain, there's a letter for you; i saw't. <END>
a letter for me! it gives me an estate of seven <END>
years' health; in which time i will make a lip at <END>
the physician: the most sovereign prescription in <END>
galen is but empiricutic, and, to this preservative, <END>
of no better report than a horse-drench. is he <END>
not wounded? he was wont to come home wounded. <END>
o, no, no, no. <END>
o, he is wounded; i thank the gods for't. <END>
so do i too, if it be not too much: brings a' <END>
victory in his pocket? the wounds become him. <END>
on's brows: menenius, he comes the third time home <END>
with the oaken garland. <END>
has he disciplined aufidius soundly? <END>
titus lartius writes, they fought together, but <END>
aufidius got off. <END>
and 'twas time for him too, i'll warrant him that: <END>
an he had stayed by him, i would not have been so <END>
fidiused for all the chests in corioli, and the gold <END>
that's in them. is the senate possessed of this? <END>
good ladies, let's go. yes, yes, yes; the senate <END>
has letters from the general, wherein he gives my <END>
son the whole name of the war: he hath in this <END>
action outdone his former deeds doubly <END>
in troth, there's wondrous things spoke of him. <END>
wondrous! ay, i warrant you, and not without his <END>
true purchasing. <END>
the gods grant them true! <END>
true! pow, wow. <END>
true! i'll be sworn they are true. <END>
where is he wounded? <END>
god save your good worships! marcius is coming <END>
home: he has more cause to be proud. where is he wounded? <END>
i' the shoulder and i' the left arm there will be <END>
large cicatrices to show the people, when he shall <END>
stand for his place. he received in the repulse of <END>
tarquin seven hurts i' the body. <END>
one i' the neck, and two i' the thigh,--there's <END>
nine that i know. <END>
he had, before this last expedition, twenty-five <END>
wounds upon him. <END>
now it's twenty-seven: every gash was an enemy's grave. <END>
hark! the trumpets. <END>
these are the ushers of marcius: before him he <END>
carries noise, and behind him he leaves tears: <END>
death, that dark spirit, in 's nervy arm doth lie; <END>
which, being advanced, declines, and then men die. <END>
know, rome, that all alone marcius did fight <END>
within corioli gates: where he hath won, <END>
with fame, a name to caius marcius; these <END>
in honour follows coriolanus. <END>
welcome to rome, renowned coriolanus! <END>
welcome to rome, renowned coriolanus! <END>
no more of this; it does offend my heart: <END>
pray now, no more. <END>
look, sir, your mother! <END>
o, <END>
you have, i know, petition'd all the gods <END>
for my prosperity! <END>
nay, my good soldier, up; <END>
my gentle marcius, worthy caius, and <END>
by deed-achieving honour newly named,-- <END>
what is it?--coriolanus must i call thee?-- <END>
but o, thy wife! <END>
my gracious silence, hail! <END>
wouldst thou have laugh'd had i come coffin'd home, <END>
that weep'st to see me triumph? ay, my dear, <END>
such eyes the widows in corioli wear, <END>
and mothers that lack sons. <END>
now, the gods crown thee! <END>
and live you yet? <END>
o my sweet lady, pardon. <END>
i know not where to turn: o, welcome home: <END>
and welcome, general: and ye're welcome all. <END>
a hundred thousand welcomes. i could weep <END>
and i could laugh, i am light and heavy. welcome. <END>
a curse begin at very root on's heart, <END>
that is not glad to see thee! you are three <END>
that rome should dote on: yet, by the faith of men, <END>
we have some old crab-trees here <END>
at home that will not <END>
be grafted to your relish. yet welcome, warriors: <END>
we call a nettle but a nettle and <END>
the faults of fools but folly. <END>
ever right. <END>
menenius ever, ever. <END>
give way there, and go on! <END>
i have lived <END>
to see inherited my very wishes <END>
and the buildings of my fancy: only <END>
there's one thing wanting, which i doubt not but <END>
our rome will cast upon thee. <END>
know, good mother, <END>
i had rather be their servant in my way, <END>
than sway with them in theirs. <END>
on, to the capitol! <END>
all tongues speak of him, and the bleared sights <END>
are spectacled to see him: your prattling nurse <END>
into a rapture lets her baby cry <END>
while she chats him: the kitchen malkin pins <END>
her richest lockram 'bout her reechy neck, <END>
clambering the walls to eye him: stalls, bulks, windows, <END>
are smother'd up, leads fill'd, and ridges horsed <END>
with variable complexions, all agreeing <END>
in earnestness to see him: seld-shown flamens <END>
do press among the popular throngs and puff <END>
to win a vulgar station: or veil'd dames <END>
commit the war of white and damask in <END>
their nicely-gawded cheeks to the wanton spoil <END>
of phoebus' burning kisses: such a pother <END>
as if that whatsoever god who leads him <END>
were slily crept into his human powers <END>
and gave him graceful posture. <END>
on the sudden, <END>
i warrant him consul. <END>
then our office may, <END>
during his power, go sleep. <END>
he cannot temperately transport his honours <END>
from where he should begin and end, but will <END>
lose those he hath won. <END>
in that there's comfort. <END>
doubt not <END>
the commoners, for whom we stand, but they <END>
upon their ancient malice will forget <END>
with the least cause these his new honours, which <END>
that he will give them make i as little question <END>
as he is proud to do't. <END>
i heard him swear, <END>
were he to stand for consul, never would he <END>
appear i' the market-place nor on him put <END>
the napless vesture of humility; <END>
nor showing, as the manner is, his wounds <END>
to the people, beg their stinking breaths. <END>
'tis right. <END>
it was his word: o, he would miss it rather <END>
than carry it but by the suit of the gentry to him, <END>
and the desire of the nobles. <END>
i wish no better <END>
than have him hold that purpose and to put it <END>
in execution. <END>
'tis most like he will. <END>
it shall be to him then as our good wills, <END>
a sure destruction. <END>
so it must fall out <END>
to him or our authorities. for an end, <END>
we must suggest the people in what hatred <END>
he still hath held them; that to's power he would <END>
have made them mules, silenced their pleaders and <END>
dispropertied their freedoms, holding them, <END>
in human action and capacity, <END>
of no more soul nor fitness for the world <END>
than camels in the war, who have their provand <END>
only for bearing burdens, and sore blows <END>
for sinking under them. <END>
this, as you say, suggested <END>
at some time when his soaring insolence <END>
shall touch the people--which time shall not want, <END>
if he be put upon 't; and that's as easy <END>
as to set dogs on sheep--will be his fire <END>
to kindle their dry stubble; and their blaze <END>
shall darken him for ever. <END>
what's the matter? <END>
you are sent for to the capitol. 'tis thought <END>
that marcius shall be consul: <END>
i have seen the dumb men throng to see him and <END>
the blind to bear him speak: matrons flung gloves, <END>
ladies and maids their scarfs and handkerchers, <END>
upon him as he pass'd: the nobles bended, <END>
as to jove's statue, and the commons made <END>
a shower and thunder with their caps and shouts: <END>
i never saw the like. <END>
let's to the capitol; <END>
and carry with us ears and eyes for the time, <END>
but hearts for the event. <END>
have with you. <END>
come, come, they are almost here. how many stand <END>
for consulships? <END>
three, they say: but 'tis thought of every one <END>
coriolanus will carry it. <END>
that's a brave fellow; but he's vengeance proud, and <END>
loves not the common people. <END>
faith, there had been many great men that have <END>
flattered the people, who ne'er loved them; and there <END>
be many that they have loved, they know not <END>
wherefore: so that, if they love they know not why, <END>
they hate upon no better a ground: therefore, for <END>
coriolanus neither to care whether they love or hate <END>
him manifests the true knowledge he has in their <END>
disposition; and out of his noble carelessness lets <END>
them plainly see't. <END>
if he did not care whether he had their love or no, <END>
he waved indifferently 'twixt doing them neither <END>
good nor harm: but he seeks their hate with greater <END>
devotion than can render it him; and leaves <END>
nothing undone that may fully discover him their <END>
opposite. now, to seem to affect the malice and <END>
displeasure of the people is as bad as that which he <END>
dislikes, to flatter them for their love. <END>
he hath deserved worthily of his country: and his <END>
ascent is not by such easy degrees as those who, <END>
having been supple and courteous to the people, <END>
bonneted, without any further deed to have them at <END>
an into their estimation and report: but he hath so <END>
planted his honours in their eyes, and his actions <END>
in their hearts, that for their tongues to be <END>
silent, and not confess so much, were a kind of <END>
ingrateful injury; to report otherwise, were a <END>
malice, that, giving itself the lie, would pluck <END>
reproof and rebuke from every ear that heard it. <END>
no more of him; he is a worthy man: make way, they <END>
are coming. <END>
having determined of the volsces and <END>
to send for titus lartius, it remains, <END>
as the main point of this our after-meeting, <END>
to gratify his noble service that <END>
hath thus stood for his country: therefore, <END>
please you, <END>
most reverend and grave elders, to desire <END>
the present consul, and last general <END>
in our well-found successes, to report <END>
a little of that worthy work perform'd <END>
by caius marcius coriolanus, whom <END>
we met here both to thank and to remember <END>
with honours like himself. <END>
speak, good cominius: <END>
leave nothing out for length, and make us think <END>
rather our state's defective for requital <END>
than we to stretch it out. <END>
masters o' the people, <END>
we do request your kindest ears, and after, <END>
your loving motion toward the common body, <END>
to yield what passes here. <END>
we are convented <END>
upon a pleasing treaty, and have hearts <END>
inclinable to honour and advance <END>
the theme of our assembly. <END>
which the rather <END>
we shall be blest to do, if he remember <END>
a kinder value of the people than <END>
he hath hereto prized them at. <END>
that's off, that's off; <END>
i would you rather had been silent. please you <END>
to hear cominius speak? <END>
most willingly; <END>
but yet my caution was more pertinent <END>
than the rebuke you give it. <END>
he loves your people <END>
but tie him not to be their bedfellow. <END>
worthy cominius, speak. <END>
nay, keep your place. <END>
sit, coriolanus; never shame to hear <END>
what you have nobly done. <END>
your horror's pardon: <END>
i had rather have my wounds to heal again <END>
than hear say how i got them. <END>
sir, i hope <END>
my words disbench'd you not. <END>
no, sir: yet oft, <END>
when blows have made me stay, i fled from words. <END>
you soothed not, therefore hurt not: but <END>
your people, <END>
i love them as they weigh. <END>
pray now, sit down. <END>
i had rather have one scratch my head i' the sun <END>
when the alarum were struck than idly sit <END>
to hear my nothings monster'd. <END>
masters of the people, <END>
your multiplying spawn how can he flatter-- <END>
that's thousand to one good one--when you now see <END>
he had rather venture all his limbs for honour <END>
than one on's ears to hear it? proceed, cominius. <END>
i shall lack voice: the deeds of coriolanus <END>
should not be utter'd feebly. it is held <END>
that valour is the chiefest virtue, and <END>
most dignifies the haver: if it be, <END>
the man i speak of cannot in the world <END>
be singly counterpoised. at sixteen years, <END>
when tarquin made a head for rome, he fought <END>
beyond the mark of others: our then dictator, <END>
whom with all praise i point at, saw him fight, <END>
when with his amazonian chin he drove <END>
the bristled lips before him: be bestrid <END>
an o'er-press'd roman and i' the consul's view <END>
slew three opposers: tarquin's self he met, <END>
and struck him on his knee: in that day's feats, <END>
when he might act the woman in the scene, <END>
he proved best man i' the field, and for his meed <END>
was brow-bound with the oak. his pupil age <END>
man-enter'd thus, he waxed like a sea, <END>
and in the brunt of seventeen battles since <END>
he lurch'd all swords of the garland. for this last, <END>
before and in corioli, let me say, <END>
i cannot speak him home: he stopp'd the fliers; <END>
and by his rare example made the coward <END>
turn terror into sport: as weeds before <END>
a vessel under sail, so men obey'd <END>
and fell below his stem: his sword, death's stamp, <END>
where it did mark, it took; from face to foot <END>
he was a thing of blood, whose every motion <END>
was timed with dying cries: alone he enter'd <END>
the mortal gate of the city, which he painted <END>
with shunless destiny; aidless came off, <END>
and with a sudden reinforcement struck <END>
corioli like a planet: now all's his: <END>
when, by and by, the din of war gan pierce <END>
his ready sense; then straight his doubled spirit <END>
re-quicken'd what in flesh was fatigate, <END>
and to the battle came he; where he did <END>
run reeking o'er the lives of men, as if <END>
'twere a perpetual spoil: and till we call'd <END>
both field and city ours, he never stood <END>
to ease his breast with panting. <END>
worthy man! <END>
he cannot but with measure fit the honours <END>
which we devise him. <END>
our spoils he kick'd at, <END>
and look'd upon things precious as they were <END>
the common muck of the world: he covets less <END>
than misery itself would give; rewards <END>
his deeds with doing them, and is content <END>
to spend the time to end it. <END>
he's right noble: <END>
let him be call'd for. <END>
call coriolanus. <END>
he doth appear. <END>
the senate, coriolanus, are well pleased <END>
to make thee consul. <END>
i do owe them still <END>
my life and services. <END>
it then remains <END>
that you do speak to the people. <END>
i do beseech you, <END>
let me o'erleap that custom, for i cannot <END>
put on the gown, stand naked and entreat them, <END>
for my wounds' sake, to give their suffrage: please you <END>
that i may pass this doing. <END>
sir, the people <END>
must have their voices; neither will they bate <END>
one jot of ceremony. <END>
put them not to't: <END>
pray you, go fit you to the custom and <END>
take to you, as your predecessors have, <END>
your honour with your form. <END>
it is apart <END>
that i shall blush in acting, and might well <END>
be taken from the people. <END>
mark you that? <END>
to brag unto them, thus i did, and thus; <END>
show them the unaching scars which i should hide, <END>
as if i had received them for the hire <END>
of their breath only! <END>
do not stand upon't. <END>
we recommend to you, tribunes of the people, <END>
our purpose to them: and to our noble consul <END>
wish we all joy and honour. <END>
to coriolanus come all joy and honour! <END>
you see how he intends to use the people. <END>
may they perceive's intent! he will require them, <END>
as if he did contemn what he requested <END>
should be in them to give. <END>
come, we'll inform them <END>
of our proceedings here: on the marketplace, <END>
i know, they do attend us. <END>
once, if he do require our voices, we ought not to deny him. <END>
we may, sir, if we will. <END>
we have power in ourselves to do it, but it is a <END>
power that we have no power to do; for if he show us <END>
his wounds and tell us his deeds, we are to put our <END>
tongues into those wounds and speak for them; so, if <END>
he tell us his noble deeds, we must also tell him <END>
our noble acceptance of them. ingratitude is <END>
monstrous, and for the multitude to be ingrateful, <END>
were to make a monster of the multitude: of the <END>
which we being members, should bring ourselves to be <END>
monstrous members. <END>
and to make us no better thought of, a little help <END>
will serve; for once we stood up about the corn, he <END>
himself stuck not to call us the many-headed multitude. <END>
we have been called so of many; not that our heads <END>
are some brown, some black, some auburn, some bald, <END>
but that our wits are so diversely coloured: and <END>
truly i think if all our wits were to issue out of <END>
one skull, they would fly east, west, north, south, <END>
and their consent of one direct way should be at <END>
once to all the points o' the compass. <END>
think you so? which way do you judge my wit would <END>
fly? <END>
nay, your wit will not so soon out as another man's <END>
will;'tis strongly wedged up in a block-head, but <END>
if it were at liberty, 'twould, sure, southward. <END>
why that way? <END>
to lose itself in a fog, where being three parts <END>
melted away with rotten dews, the fourth would return <END>
for conscience sake, to help to get thee a wife. <END>
you are never without your tricks: you may, you may. <END>
are you all resolved to give your voices? but <END>
that's no matter, the greater part carries it. i <END>
say, if he would incline to the people, there was <END>
never a worthier man. <END>
here he comes, and in the gown of humility: mark his <END>
behavior. we are not to stay all together, but to <END>
come by him where he stands, by ones, by twos, and <END>
by threes. he's to make his requests by <END>
particulars; wherein every one of us has a single <END>
honour, in giving him our own voices with our own <END>
tongues: therefore follow me, and i direct you how <END>
you shall go by him. <END>
content, content. <END>
o sir, you are not right: have you not known <END>
the worthiest men have done't? <END>
what must i say? <END>
'i pray, sir'--plague upon't! i cannot bring <END>
my tongue to such a pace:--'look, sir, my wounds! <END>
i got them in my country's service, when <END>
some certain of your brethren roar'd and ran <END>
from the noise of our own drums.' <END>
o me, the gods! <END>
you must not speak of that: you must desire them <END>
to think upon you. <END>
think upon me! hang 'em! <END>
i would they would forget me, like the virtues <END>
which our divines lose by 'em. <END>
you'll mar all: <END>
i'll leave you: pray you, speak to 'em, i pray you, <END>
in wholesome manner. <END>
bid them wash their faces <END>
and keep their teeth clean. <END>
so, here comes a brace. <END>
you know the cause, air, of my standing here. <END>
we do, sir; tell us what hath brought you to't. <END>
mine own desert. <END>
your own desert! <END>
ay, but not mine own desire. <END>
how not your own desire? <END>
no, sir,'twas never my desire yet to trouble the <END>
poor with begging. <END>
you must think, if we give you any thing, we hope to <END>
gain by you. <END>
well then, i pray, your price o' the consulship? <END>
the price is to ask it kindly. <END>
kindly! sir, i pray, let me ha't: i have wounds to <END>
show you, which shall be yours in private. your <END>
good voice, sir; what say you? <END>
you shall ha' it, worthy sir. <END>
a match, sir. there's in all two worthy voices <END>
begged. i have your alms: adieu. <END>
but this is something odd. <END>
an 'twere to give again,--but 'tis no matter. <END>
pray you now, if it may stand with the tune of your <END>
voices that i may be consul, i have here the <END>
customary gown. <END>
you have deserved nobly of your country, and you <END>
have not deserved nobly. <END>
your enigma? <END>
you have been a scourge to her enemies, you have <END>
been a rod to her friends; you have not indeed loved <END>
the common people. <END>
you should account me the more virtuous that i have <END>
not been common in my love. i will, sir, flatter my <END>
sworn brother, the people, to earn a dearer <END>
estimation of them; 'tis a condition they account <END>
gentle: and since the wisdom of their choice is <END>
rather to have my hat than my heart, i will practise <END>
the insinuating nod and be off to them most <END>
counterfeitly; that is, sir, i will counterfeit the <END>
bewitchment of some popular man and give it <END>
bountiful to the desirers. therefore, beseech you, <END>
i may be consul. <END>
we hope to find you our friend; and therefore give <END>
you our voices heartily. <END>
you have received many wounds for your country. <END>
i will not seal your knowledge with showing them. i <END>
will make much of your voices, and so trouble you no further. <END>
the gods give you joy, sir, heartily! <END>
most sweet voices! <END>
better it is to die, better to starve, <END>
than crave the hire which first we do deserve. <END>
why in this woolvish toge should i stand here, <END>
to beg of hob and dick, that do appear, <END>
their needless vouches? custom calls me to't: <END>
what custom wills, in all things should we do't, <END>
the dust on antique time would lie unswept, <END>
and mountainous error be too highly heapt <END>
for truth to o'er-peer. rather than fool it so, <END>
let the high office and the honour go <END>
to one that would do thus. i am half through; <END>
the one part suffer'd, the other will i do. <END>
here come more voices. <END>
your voices: for your voices i have fought; <END>
watch'd for your voices; for your voices bear <END>
of wounds two dozen odd; battles thrice six <END>
i have seen and heard of; for your voices have <END>
done many things, some less, some more your voices: <END>
indeed i would be consul. <END>
he has done nobly, and cannot go without any honest <END>
man's voice. <END>
therefore let him be consul: the gods give him joy, <END>
and make him good friend to the people! <END>
amen, amen. god save thee, noble consul! <END>
worthy voices! <END>
you have stood your limitation; and the tribunes <END>
endue you with the people's voice: remains <END>
that, in the official marks invested, you <END>
anon do meet the senate. <END>
is this done? <END>
the custom of request you have discharged: <END>
the people do admit you, and are summon'd <END>
to meet anon, upon your approbation. <END>
where? at the senate-house? <END>
there, coriolanus. <END>
may i change these garments? <END>
you may, sir. <END>
that i'll straight do; and, knowing myself again, <END>
repair to the senate-house. <END>
i'll keep you company. will you along? <END>
we stay here for the people. <END>
fare you well. <END>
he has it now, and by his looks methink <END>
'tis warm at 's heart. <END>
with a proud heart he wore his humble weeds. <END>
will you dismiss the people? <END>
how now, my masters! have you chose this man? <END>
he has our voices, sir. <END>
we pray the gods he may deserve your loves. <END>
amen, sir: to my poor unworthy notice, <END>
he mock'd us when he begg'd our voices. <END>
certainly <END>
he flouted us downright. <END>
no,'tis his kind of speech: he did not mock us. <END>
not one amongst us, save yourself, but says <END>
he used us scornfully: he should have show'd us <END>
his marks of merit, wounds received for's country. <END>
why, so he did, i am sure. <END>
no, no; no man saw 'em. <END>
he said he had wounds, which he could show <END>
in private; <END>
and with his hat, thus waving it in scorn, <END>
'i would be consul,' says he: 'aged custom, <END>
but by your voices, will not so permit me; <END>
your voices therefore.' when we granted that, <END>
here was 'i thank you for your voices: thank you: <END>
your most sweet voices: now you have left <END>
your voices, <END>
i have no further with you.' was not this mockery? <END>
why either were you ignorant to see't, <END>
or, seeing it, of such childish friendliness <END>
to yield your voices? <END>
could you not have told him <END>
as you were lesson'd, when he had no power, <END>
but was a petty servant to the state, <END>
he was your enemy, ever spake against <END>
your liberties and the charters that you bear <END>
i' the body of the weal; and now, arriving <END>
a place of potency and sway o' the state, <END>
if he should still malignantly remain <END>
fast foe to the plebeii, your voices might <END>
be curses to yourselves? you should have said <END>
that as his worthy deeds did claim no less <END>
than what he stood for, so his gracious nature <END>
would think upon you for your voices and <END>
translate his malice towards you into love, <END>
standing your friendly lord. <END>
thus to have said, <END>
as you were fore-advised, had touch'd his spirit <END>
and tried his inclination; from him pluck'd <END>
either his gracious promise, which you might, <END>
as cause had call'd you up, have held him to <END>
or else it would have gall'd his surly nature, <END>
which easily endures not article <END>
tying him to aught; so putting him to rage, <END>
you should have ta'en the advantage of his choler <END>
and pass'd him unelected. <END>
did you perceive <END>
he did solicit you in free contempt <END>
when he did need your loves, and do you think <END>
that his contempt shall not be bruising to you, <END>
when he hath power to crush? why, had your bodies <END>
no heart among you? or had you tongues to cry <END>
against the rectorship of judgment? <END>
have you <END>
ere now denied the asker? and now again <END>
of him that did not ask, but mock, bestow <END>
your sued-for tongues? <END>
he's not confirm'd; we may deny him yet. <END>
and will deny him: <END>
i'll have five hundred voices of that sound. <END>
i twice five hundred and their friends to piece 'em. <END>
get you hence instantly, and tell those friends, <END>
they have chose a consul that will from them take <END>
their liberties; make them of no more voice <END>
than dogs that are as often beat for barking <END>
as therefore kept to do so. <END>
let them assemble, <END>
and on a safer judgment all revoke <END>
your ignorant election; enforce his pride, <END>
and his old hate unto you; besides, forget not <END>
with what contempt he wore the humble weed, <END>
how in his suit he scorn'd you; but your loves, <END>
thinking upon his services, took from you <END>
the apprehension of his present portance, <END>
which most gibingly, ungravely, he did fashion <END>
after the inveterate hate he bears you. <END>
lay <END>
a fault on us, your tribunes; that we laboured, <END>
no impediment between, but that you must <END>
cast your election on him. <END>
say, you chose him <END>
more after our commandment than as guided <END>
by your own true affections, and that your minds, <END>
preoccupied with what you rather must do <END>
than what you should, made you against the grain <END>
to voice him consul: lay the fault on us. <END>
ay, spare us not. say we read lectures to you. <END>
how youngly he began to serve his country, <END>
how long continued, and what stock he springs of, <END>
the noble house o' the marcians, from whence came <END>
that ancus marcius, numa's daughter's son, <END>
who, after great hostilius, here was king; <END>
of the same house publius and quintus were, <END>
that our beat water brought by conduits hither; <END>
and <END>
twice being <END>
was his great ancestor. <END>
one thus descended, <END>
that hath beside well in his person wrought <END>
to be set high in place, we did commend <END>
to your remembrances: but you have found, <END>
scaling his present bearing with his past, <END>
that he's your fixed enemy, and revoke <END>
your sudden approbation. <END>
say, you ne'er had done't-- <END>
harp on that still--but by our putting on; <END>
and presently, when you have drawn your number, <END>
repair to the capitol. <END>
we will so: almost all <END>
repent in their election. <END>
let them go on; <END>
this mutiny were better put in hazard, <END>
than stay, past doubt, for greater: <END>
if, as his nature is, he fall in rage <END>
with their refusal, both observe and answer <END>
the vantage of his anger. <END>
to the capitol, come: <END>
we will be there before the stream o' the people; <END>
and this shall seem, as partly 'tis, their own, <END>
which we have goaded onward. <END>
tullus aufidius then had made new head? <END>
he had, my lord; and that it was which caused <END>
our swifter composition. <END>
so then the volsces stand but as at first, <END>
ready, when time shall prompt them, to make road. <END>
upon's again. <END>
they are worn, lord consul, so, <END>
that we shall hardly in our ages see <END>
their banners wave again. <END>
saw you aufidius? <END>
on safe-guard he came to me; and did curse <END>
against the volsces, for they had so vilely <END>
yielded the town: he is retired to antium. <END>
spoke he of me? <END>
he did, my lord. <END>
how? what? <END>
how often he had met you, sword to sword; <END>
that of all things upon the earth he hated <END>
your person most, that he would pawn his fortunes <END>
to hopeless restitution, so he might <END>
be call'd your vanquisher. <END>
at antium lives he? <END>
at antium. <END>
i wish i had a cause to seek him there, <END>
to oppose his hatred fully. welcome home. <END>
behold, these are the tribunes of the people, <END>
the tongues o' the common mouth: i do despise them; <END>
for they do prank them in authority, <END>
against all noble sufferance. <END>
pass no further. <END>
ha! what is that? <END>
it will be dangerous to go on: no further. <END>
what makes this change? <END>
the matter? <END>
hath he not pass'd the noble and the common? <END>
cominius, no. <END>
have i had children's voices? <END>
tribunes, give way; he shall to the market-place. <END>
the people are incensed against him. <END>
stop, <END>
or all will fall in broil. <END>
are these your herd? <END>
must these have voices, that can yield them now <END>
and straight disclaim their tongues? what are <END>
your offices? <END>
you being their mouths, why rule you not their teeth? <END>
have you not set them on? <END>
be calm, be calm. <END>
it is a purposed thing, and grows by plot, <END>
to curb the will of the nobility: <END>
suffer't, and live with such as cannot rule <END>
nor ever will be ruled. <END>
call't not a plot: <END>
the people cry you mock'd them, and of late, <END>
when corn was given them gratis, you repined; <END>
scandal'd the suppliants for the people, call'd them <END>
time-pleasers, flatterers, foes to nobleness. <END>
why, this was known before. <END>
not to them all. <END>
have you inform'd them sithence? <END>
how! i inform them! <END>
you are like to do such business. <END>
not unlike, <END>
each way, to better yours. <END>
why then should i be consul? by yond clouds, <END>
let me deserve so ill as you, and make me <END>
your fellow tribune. <END>
you show too much of that <END>
for which the people stir: if you will pass <END>
to where you are bound, you must inquire your way, <END>
which you are out of, with a gentler spirit, <END>
or never be so noble as a consul, <END>
nor yoke with him for tribune. <END>
let's be calm. <END>
the people are abused; set on. this paltering <END>
becomes not rome, nor has coriolanus <END>
deserved this so dishonour'd rub, laid falsely <END>
i' the plain way of his merit. <END>
tell me of corn! <END>
this was my speech, and i will speak't again-- <END>
not now, not now. <END>
not in this heat, sir, now. <END>
now, as i live, i will. my nobler friends, <END>
i crave their pardons: <END>
for the mutable, rank-scented many, let them <END>
regard me as i do not flatter, and <END>
therein behold themselves: i say again, <END>
in soothing them, we nourish 'gainst our senate <END>
the cockle of rebellion, insolence, sedition, <END>
which we ourselves have plough'd for, sow'd, <END>
and scatter'd, <END>
by mingling them with us, the honour'd number, <END>
who lack not virtue, no, nor power, but that <END>
which they have given to beggars. <END>
well, no more. <END>
no more words, we beseech you. <END>
how! no more! <END>
as for my country i have shed my blood, <END>
not fearing outward force, so shall my lungs <END>
coin words till their decay against those measles, <END>
which we disdain should tatter us, yet sought <END>
the very way to catch them. <END>
you speak o' the people, <END>
as if you were a god to punish, not <END>
a man of their infirmity. <END>
'twere well <END>
we let the people know't. <END>
what, what? his choler? <END>
choler! <END>
were i as patient as the midnight sleep, <END>
by jove, 'twould be my mind! <END>
it is a mind <END>
that shall remain a poison where it is, <END>
not poison any further. <END>
shall remain! <END>
hear you this triton of the minnows? mark you <END>
his absolute 'shall'? <END>
'twas from the canon. <END>
'shall'! <END>
o good but most unwise patricians! why, <END>
you grave but reckless senators, have you thus <END>
given hydra here to choose an officer, <END>
that with his peremptory 'shall,' being but <END>
the horn and noise o' the monster's, wants not spirit <END>
to say he'll turn your current in a ditch, <END>
and make your channel his? if he have power <END>
then vail your ignorance; if none, awake <END>
your dangerous lenity. if you are learn'd, <END>
be not as common fools; if you are not, <END>
let them have cushions by you. you are plebeians, <END>
if they be senators: and they are no less, <END>
when, both your voices blended, the great'st taste <END>
most palates theirs. they choose their magistrate, <END>
and such a one as he, who puts his 'shall,' <END>
his popular 'shall' against a graver bench <END>
than ever frown in greece. by jove himself! <END>
it makes the consuls base: and my soul aches <END>
to know, when two authorities are up, <END>
neither supreme, how soon confusion <END>
may enter 'twixt the gap of both and take <END>
the one by the other. <END>
well, on to the market-place. <END>
whoever gave that counsel, to give forth <END>
the corn o' the storehouse gratis, as 'twas used <END>
sometime in greece,-- <END>
well, well, no more of that. <END>
though there the people had more absolute power, <END>
i say, they nourish'd disobedience, fed <END>
the ruin of the state. <END>
why, shall the people give <END>
one that speaks thus their voice? <END>
i'll give my reasons, <END>
more worthier than their voices. they know the corn <END>
was not our recompense, resting well assured <END>
that ne'er did service for't: being press'd to the war, <END>
even when the navel of the state was touch'd, <END>
they would not thread the gates. this kind of service <END>
did not deserve corn gratis. being i' the war <END>
their mutinies and revolts, wherein they show'd <END>
most valour, spoke not for them: the accusation <END>
which they have often made against the senate, <END>
all cause unborn, could never be the motive <END>
of our so frank donation. well, what then? <END>
how shall this bisson multitude digest <END>
the senate's courtesy? let deeds express <END>
what's like to be their words: 'we did request it; <END>
we are the greater poll, and in true fear <END>
they gave us our demands.' thus we debase <END>
the nature of our seats and make the rabble <END>
call our cares fears; which will in time <END>
break ope the locks o' the senate and bring in <END>
the crows to peck the eagles. <END>
come, enough. <END>
enough, with over-measure. <END>
no, take more: <END>
what may be sworn by, both divine and human, <END>
seal what i end withal! this double worship, <END>
where one part does disdain with cause, the other <END>
insult without all reason, where gentry, title, wisdom, <END>
cannot conclude but by the yea and no <END>
of general ignorance,--it must omit <END>
real necessities, and give way the while <END>
to unstable slightness: purpose so barr'd, <END>
it follows, <END>
nothing is done to purpose. therefore, beseech you,-- <END>
you that will be less fearful than discreet, <END>
that love the fundamental part of state <END>
more than you doubt the change on't, that prefer <END>
a noble life before a long, and wish <END>
to jump a body with a dangerous physic <END>
that's sure of death without it, at once pluck out <END>
the multitudinous tongue; let them not lick <END>
the sweet which is their poison: your dishonour <END>
mangles true judgment and bereaves the state <END>
of that integrity which should become't, <END>
not having the power to do the good it would, <END>
for the in which doth control't. <END>
has said enough. <END>
has spoken like a traitor, and shall answer <END>
as traitors do. <END>
thou wretch, despite o'erwhelm thee! <END>
what should the people do with these bald tribunes? <END>
on whom depending, their obedience fails <END>
to the greater bench: in a rebellion, <END>
when what's not meet, but what must be, was law, <END>
then were they chosen: in a better hour, <END>
let what is meet be said it must be meet, <END>
and throw their power i' the dust. <END>
manifest treason! <END>
this a consul? no. <END>
the aediles, ho! <END>
let him be apprehended. <END>
go, call the people: <END>
in whose name myself <END>
attach thee as a traitorous innovator, <END>
a foe to the public weal: obey, i charge thee, <END>
and follow to thine answer. <END>
hence, old goat! <END>
senators, &c: <END>
we'll surety him. <END>
aged sir, hands off. <END>
hence, rotten thing! or i shall shake thy bones <END>
out of thy garments. <END>
help, ye citizens! <END>
on both sides more respect. <END>
here's he that would take from you all your power. <END>
seize him, aediles! <END>
down with him! down with him! <END>
senators, &c: <END>
weapons, weapons, weapons! <END>
'tribunes!' 'patricians!' 'citizens!' 'what, ho!' <END>
'sicinius!' 'brutus!' 'coriolanus!' 'citizens!' <END>
'peace, peace, peace!' 'stay, hold, peace!' <END>
what is about to be? i am out of breath; <END>
confusion's near; i cannot speak. you, tribunes <END>
to the people! coriolanus, patience! <END>
speak, good sicinius. <END>
hear me, people; peace! <END>
let's hear our tribune: peace speak, speak, speak. <END>
you are at point to lose your liberties: <END>
marcius would have all from you; marcius, <END>
whom late you have named for consul. <END>
fie, fie, fie! <END>
this is the way to kindle, not to quench. <END>
to unbuild the city and to lay all flat. <END>
what is the city but the people? <END>
true, <END>
the people are the city. <END>
by the consent of all, we were establish'd <END>
the people's magistrates. <END>
you so remain. <END>
and so are like to do. <END>
that is the way to lay the city flat; <END>
to bring the roof to the foundation, <END>
and bury all, which yet distinctly ranges, <END>
in heaps and piles of ruin. <END>
this deserves death. <END>
or let us stand to our authority, <END>
or let us lose it. we do here pronounce, <END>
upon the part o' the people, in whose power <END>
we were elected theirs, marcius is worthy <END>
of present death. <END>
therefore lay hold of him; <END>
bear him to the rock tarpeian, and from thence <END>
into destruction cast him. <END>
aediles, seize him! <END>
yield, marcius, yield! <END>
hear me one word; <END>
beseech you, tribunes, hear me but a word. <END>
aedile: <END>
peace, peace! <END>
sir, those cold ways, <END>
that seem like prudent helps, are very poisonous <END>
where the disease is violent. lay hands upon him, <END>
and bear him to the rock. <END>
no, i'll die here. <END>
there's some among you have beheld me fighting: <END>
come, try upon yourselves what you have seen me. <END>
down with that sword! tribunes, withdraw awhile. <END>
lay hands upon him. <END>
help marcius, help, <END>
you that be noble; help him, young and old! <END>
down with him, down with him! <END>
go, get you to your house; be gone, away! <END>
all will be naught else. <END>
get you gone. <END>
stand fast; <END>
we have as many friends as enemies. <END>
sham it be put to that? <END>
the gods forbid! <END>
i prithee, noble friend, home to thy house; <END>
leave us to cure this cause. <END>
for 'tis a sore upon us, <END>
you cannot tent yourself: be gone, beseech you. <END>
come, sir, along with us. <END>
i would they were barbarians--as they are, <END>
though in rome litter'd--not romans--as they are not, <END>
though calved i' the porch o' the capitol-- <END>
be gone; <END>
put not your worthy rage into your tongue; <END>
one time will owe another. <END>
on fair ground <END>
i could beat forty of them. <END>
i could myself <END>
take up a brace o' the best of them; yea, the <END>
two tribunes: <END>
but now 'tis odds beyond arithmetic; <END>
and manhood is call'd foolery, when it stands <END>
against a falling fabric. will you hence, <END>
before the tag return? whose rage doth rend <END>
like interrupted waters and o'erbear <END>
what they are used to bear. <END>
pray you, be gone: <END>
i'll try whether my old wit be in request <END>
with those that have but little: this must be patch'd <END>
with cloth of any colour. <END>
nay, come away. <END>
a patrician: <END>
this man has marr'd his fortune. <END>
his nature is too noble for the world: <END>
he would not flatter neptune for his trident, <END>
or jove for's power to thunder. his heart's his mouth: <END>
what his breast forges, that his tongue must vent; <END>
and, being angry, does forget that ever <END>
he heard the name of death. <END>
here's goodly work! <END>
i would they were abed! <END>
i would they were in tiber! what the vengeance! <END>
could he not speak 'em fair? <END>
where is this viper <END>
that would depopulate the city and <END>
be every man himself? <END>
you worthy tribunes,-- <END>
he shall be thrown down the tarpeian rock <END>
with rigorous hands: he hath resisted law, <END>
and therefore law shall scorn him further trial <END>
than the severity of the public power <END>
which he so sets at nought. <END>
he shall well know <END>
the noble tribunes are the people's mouths, <END>
and we their hands. <END>
he shall, sure on't. <END>
sir, sir,-- <END>
peace! <END>
do not cry havoc, where you should but hunt <END>
with modest warrant. <END>
sir, how comes't that you <END>
have holp to make this rescue? <END>
hear me speak: <END>
as i do know the consul's worthiness, <END>
so can i name his faults,-- <END>
consul! what consul? <END>
the consul coriolanus. <END>
he consul! <END>
no, no, no, no, no. <END>
if, by the tribunes' leave, and yours, good people, <END>
i may be heard, i would crave a word or two; <END>
the which shall turn you to no further harm <END>
than so much loss of time. <END>
speak briefly then; <END>
for we are peremptory to dispatch <END>
this viperous traitor: to eject him hence <END>
were but one danger, and to keep him here <END>
our certain death: therefore it is decreed <END>
he dies to-night. <END>
now the good gods forbid <END>
that our renowned rome, whose gratitude <END>
towards her deserved children is enroll'd <END>
in jove's own book, like an unnatural dam <END>
should now eat up her own! <END>
he's a disease that must be cut away. <END>
o, he's a limb that has but a disease; <END>
mortal, to cut it off; to cure it, easy. <END>
what has he done to rome that's worthy death? <END>
killing our enemies, the blood he hath lost-- <END>
which, i dare vouch, is more than that he hath, <END>
by many an ounce--he dropp'd it for his country; <END>
and what is left, to lose it by his country, <END>
were to us all, that do't and suffer it, <END>
a brand to the end o' the world. <END>
this is clean kam. <END>
merely awry: when he did love his country, <END>
it honour'd him. <END>
the service of the foot <END>
being once gangrened, is not then respected <END>
for what before it was. <END>
we'll hear no more. <END>
pursue him to his house, and pluck him thence: <END>
lest his infection, being of catching nature, <END>
spread further. <END>
one word more, one word. <END>
this tiger-footed rage, when it shall find <END>
the harm of unscann'd swiftness, will too late <END>
tie leaden pounds to's heels. proceed by process; <END>
lest parties, as he is beloved, break out, <END>
and sack great rome with romans. <END>
if it were so,-- <END>
what do ye talk? <END>
have we not had a taste of his obedience? <END>
our aediles smote? ourselves resisted? come. <END>
consider this: he has been bred i' the wars <END>
since he could draw a sword, and is ill school'd <END>
in bolted language; meal and bran together <END>
he throws without distinction. give me leave, <END>
i'll go to him, and undertake to bring him <END>
where he shall answer, by a lawful form, <END>
in peace, to his utmost peril. <END>
noble tribunes, <END>
it is the humane way: the other course <END>
will prove too bloody, and the end of it <END>
unknown to the beginning. <END>
noble menenius, <END>
be you then as the people's officer. <END>
masters, lay down your weapons. <END>
go not home. <END>
meet on the market-place. we'll attend you there: <END>
where, if you bring not marcius, we'll proceed <END>
in our first way. <END>
i'll bring him to you. <END>
let me desire your company: he must come, <END>
or what is worst will follow. <END>
pray you, let's to him. <END>
let them puff all about mine ears, present me <END>
death on the wheel or at wild horses' heels, <END>
or pile ten hills on the tarpeian rock, <END>
that the precipitation might down stretch <END>
below the beam of sight, yet will i still <END>
be thus to them. <END>
a patrician: <END>
you do the nobler. <END>
i muse my mother <END>
does not approve me further, who was wont <END>
to call them woollen vassals, things created <END>
to buy and sell with groats, to show bare heads <END>
in congregations, to yawn, be still and wonder, <END>
when one but of my ordinance stood up <END>
to speak of peace or war. <END>
i talk of you: <END>
why did you wish me milder? would you have me <END>
false to my nature? rather say i play <END>
the man i am. <END>
o, sir, sir, sir, <END>
i would have had you put your power well on, <END>
before you had worn it out. <END>
let go. <END>
you might have been enough the man you are, <END>
with striving less to be so; lesser had been <END>
the thwartings of your dispositions, if <END>
you had not show'd them how ye were disposed <END>
ere they lack'd power to cross you. <END>
let them hang. <END>
a patrician: <END>
ay, and burn too. <END>
come, come, you have been too rough, something <END>
too rough; <END>
you must return and mend it. <END>
there's no remedy; <END>
unless, by not so doing, our good city <END>
cleave in the midst, and perish. <END>
pray, be counsell'd: <END>
i have a heart as little apt as yours, <END>
but yet a brain that leads my use of anger <END>
to better vantage. <END>
well said, noble woman? <END>
before he should thus stoop to the herd, but that <END>
the violent fit o' the time craves it as physic <END>
for the whole state, i would put mine armour on, <END>
which i can scarcely bear. <END>
what must i do? <END>
return to the tribunes. <END>
well, what then? what then? <END>
repent what you have spoke. <END>
for them! i cannot do it to the gods; <END>
must i then do't to them? <END>
you are too absolute; <END>
though therein you can never be too noble, <END>
but when extremities speak. i have heard you say, <END>
honour and policy, like unsever'd friends, <END>
i' the war do grow together: grant that, and tell me, <END>
in peace what each of them by the other lose, <END>
that they combine not there. <END>
tush, tush! <END>
a good demand. <END>
if it be honour in your wars to seem <END>
the same you are not, which, for your best ends, <END>
you adopt your policy, how is it less or worse, <END>
that it shall hold companionship in peace <END>
with honour, as in war, since that to both <END>
it stands in like request? <END>
why force you this? <END>
because that now it lies you on to speak <END>
to the people; not by your own instruction, <END>
nor by the matter which your heart prompts you, <END>
but with such words that are but rooted in <END>
your tongue, though but bastards and syllables <END>
of no allowance to your bosom's truth. <END>
now, this no more dishonours you at all <END>
than to take in a town with gentle words, <END>
which else would put you to your fortune and <END>
the hazard of much blood. <END>
i would dissemble with my nature where <END>
my fortunes and my friends at stake required <END>
i should do so in honour: i am in this, <END>
your wife, your son, these senators, the nobles; <END>
and you will rather show our general louts <END>
how you can frown than spend a fawn upon 'em, <END>
for the inheritance of their loves and safeguard <END>
of what that want might ruin. <END>
noble lady! <END>
come, go with us; speak fair: you may salve so, <END>
not what is dangerous present, but the loss <END>
of what is past. <END>
i prithee now, my son, <END>
go to them, with this bonnet in thy hand; <END>
and thus far having stretch'd it--here be with them-- <END>
thy knee bussing the stones--for in such business <END>
action is eloquence, and the eyes of the ignorant <END>
more learned than the ears--waving thy head, <END>
which often, thus, correcting thy stout heart, <END>
now humble as the ripest mulberry <END>
that will not hold the handling: or say to them, <END>
thou art their soldier, and being bred in broils <END>
hast not the soft way which, thou dost confess, <END>
were fit for thee to use as they to claim, <END>
in asking their good loves, but thou wilt frame <END>
thyself, forsooth, hereafter theirs, so far <END>
as thou hast power and person. <END>
this but done, <END>
even as she speaks, why, their hearts were yours; <END>
for they have pardons, being ask'd, as free <END>
as words to little purpose. <END>
prithee now, <END>
go, and be ruled: although i know thou hadst rather <END>
follow thine enemy in a fiery gulf <END>
than flatter him in a bower. here is cominius. <END>
i have been i' the market-place; and, sir,'tis fit <END>
you make strong party, or defend yourself <END>
by calmness or by absence: all's in anger. <END>
only fair speech. <END>
i think 'twill serve, if he <END>
can thereto frame his spirit. <END>
he must, and will <END>
prithee now, say you will, and go about it. <END>
must i go show them my unbarbed sconce? <END>
must i with base tongue give my noble heart <END>
a lie that it must bear? well, i will do't: <END>
yet, were there but this single plot to lose, <END>
this mould of marcius, they to dust should grind it <END>
and throw't against the wind. to the market-place! <END>
you have put me now to such a part which never <END>
i shall discharge to the life. <END>
come, come, we'll prompt you. <END>
i prithee now, sweet son, as thou hast said <END>
my praises made thee first a soldier, so, <END>
to have my praise for this, perform a part <END>
thou hast not done before. <END>
well, i must do't: <END>
away, my disposition, and possess me <END>
some harlot's spirit! my throat of war be turn'd, <END>
which quired with my drum, into a pipe <END>
small as an eunuch, or the virgin voice <END>
that babies lulls asleep! the smiles of knaves <END>
tent in my cheeks, and schoolboys' tears take up <END>
the glasses of my sight! a beggar's tongue <END>
make motion through my lips, and my arm'd knees, <END>
who bow'd but in my stirrup, bend like his <END>
that hath received an alms! i will not do't, <END>
lest i surcease to honour mine own truth <END>
and by my body's action teach my mind <END>
a most inherent baseness. <END>
at thy choice, then: <END>
to beg of thee, it is my more dishonour <END>
than thou of them. come all to ruin; let <END>
thy mother rather feel thy pride than fear <END>
thy dangerous stoutness, for i mock at death <END>
with as big heart as thou. do as thou list <END>
thy valiantness was mine, thou suck'dst it from me, <END>
but owe thy pride thyself. <END>
pray, be content: <END>
mother, i am going to the market-place; <END>
chide me no more. i'll mountebank their loves, <END>
cog their hearts from them, and come home beloved <END>
of all the trades in rome. look, i am going: <END>
commend me to my wife. i'll return consul; <END>
or never trust to what my tongue can do <END>
i' the way of flattery further. <END>
do your will. <END>
away! the tribunes do attend you: arm yourself <END>
to answer mildly; for they are prepared <END>
with accusations, as i hear, more strong <END>
than are upon you yet. <END>
the word is 'mildly.' pray you, let us go: <END>
let them accuse me by invention, i <END>
will answer in mine honour. <END>
ay, but mildly. <END>
well, mildly be it then. mildly! <END>
in this point charge him home, that he affects <END>
tyrannical power: if he evade us there, <END>
enforce him with his envy to the people, <END>
and that the spoil got on the antiates <END>
was ne'er distributed. <END>
what, will he come? <END>
aedile: <END>
he's coming. <END>
how accompanied? <END>
aedile: <END>
with old menenius, and those senators <END>
that always favour'd him. <END>
have you a catalogue <END>
of all the voices that we have procured <END>
set down by the poll? <END>
aedile: <END>
i have; 'tis ready. <END>
have you collected them by tribes? <END>
aedile: <END>
i have. <END>
assemble presently the people hither; <END>
and when they bear me say 'it shall be so <END>
i' the right and strength o' the commons,' be it either <END>
for death, for fine, or banishment, then let them <END>
if i say fine, cry 'fine;' if death, cry 'death.' <END>
insisting on the old prerogative <END>
and power i' the truth o' the cause. <END>
aedile: <END>
i shall inform them. <END>
and when such time they have begun to cry, <END>
let them not cease, but with a din confused <END>
enforce the present execution <END>
of what we chance to sentence. <END>
aedile: <END>
very well. <END>
make them be strong and ready for this hint, <END>
when we shall hap to give 't them. <END>
go about it. <END>
put him to choler straight: he hath been used <END>
ever to conquer, and to have his worth <END>
of contradiction: being once chafed, he cannot <END>
be rein'd again to temperance; then he speaks <END>
what's in his heart; and that is there which looks <END>
with us to break his neck. <END>
well, here he comes. <END>
calmly, i do beseech you. <END>
ay, as an ostler, that for the poorest piece <END>
will bear the knave by the volume. the honour'd gods <END>
keep rome in safety, and the chairs of justice <END>
supplied with worthy men! plant love among 's! <END>
throng our large temples with the shows of peace, <END>
and not our streets with war! <END>
amen, amen. <END>
a noble wish. <END>
draw near, ye people. <END>
aedile: <END>
list to your tribunes. audience: peace, i say! <END>
first, hear me speak. <END>
well, say. peace, ho! <END>
shall i be charged no further than this present? <END>
must all determine here? <END>
i do demand, <END>
if you submit you to the people's voices, <END>
allow their officers and are content <END>
to suffer lawful censure for such faults <END>
as shall be proved upon you? <END>
i am content. <END>
lo, citizens, he says he is content: <END>
the warlike service he has done, consider; think <END>
upon the wounds his body bears, which show <END>
like graves i' the holy churchyard. <END>
scratches with briers, <END>
scars to move laughter only. <END>
consider further, <END>
that when he speaks not like a citizen, <END>
you find him like a soldier: do not take <END>
his rougher accents for malicious sounds, <END>
but, as i say, such as become a soldier, <END>
rather than envy you. <END>
well, well, no more. <END>
what is the matter <END>
that being pass'd for consul with full voice, <END>
i am so dishonour'd that the very hour <END>
you take it off again? <END>
answer to us. <END>
say, then: 'tis true, i ought so. <END>
we charge you, that you have contrived to take <END>
from rome all season'd office and to wind <END>
yourself into a power tyrannical; <END>
for which you are a traitor to the people. <END>
how! traitor! <END>
nay, temperately; your promise. <END>
the fires i' the lowest hell fold-in the people! <END>
call me their traitor! thou injurious tribune! <END>
within thine eyes sat twenty thousand deaths, <END>
in thy hand clutch'd as many millions, in <END>
thy lying tongue both numbers, i would say <END>
'thou liest' unto thee with a voice as free <END>
as i do pray the gods. <END>
mark you this, people? <END>
to the rock, to the rock with him! <END>
peace! <END>
we need not put new matter to his charge: <END>
what you have seen him do and heard him speak, <END>
beating your officers, cursing yourselves, <END>
opposing laws with strokes and here defying <END>
those whose great power must try him; even this, <END>
so criminal and in such capital kind, <END>
deserves the extremest death. <END>
but since he hath <END>
served well for rome,-- <END>
what do you prate of service? <END>
i talk of that, that know it. <END>
you? <END>
is this the promise that you made your mother? <END>
know, i pray you,-- <END>
i know no further: <END>
let them pronounce the steep tarpeian death, <END>
vagabond exile, raying, pent to linger <END>
but with a grain a day, i would not buy <END>
their mercy at the price of one fair word; <END>
nor cheque my courage for what they can give, <END>
to have't with saying 'good morrow.' <END>
for that he has, <END>
as much as in him lies, from time to time <END>
envied against the people, seeking means <END>
to pluck away their power, as now at last <END>
given hostile strokes, and that not in the presence <END>
of dreaded justice, but on the ministers <END>
that do distribute it; in the name o' the people <END>
and in the power of us the tribunes, we, <END>
even from this instant, banish him our city, <END>
in peril of precipitation <END>
from off the rock tarpeian never more <END>
to enter our rome gates: i' the people's name, <END>
i say it shall be so. <END>
it shall be so, it shall be so; let him away: <END>
he's banish'd, and it shall be so. <END>
hear me, my masters, and my common friends,-- <END>
he's sentenced; no more hearing. <END>
let me speak: <END>
i have been consul, and can show for rome <END>
her enemies' marks upon me. i do love <END>
my country's good with a respect more tender, <END>
more holy and profound, than mine own life, <END>
my dear wife's estimate, her womb's increase, <END>
and treasure of my loins; then if i would <END>
speak that,-- <END>
we know your drift: speak what? <END>
there's no more to be said, but he is banish'd, <END>
as enemy to the people and his country: <END>
it shall be so. <END>
it shall be so, it shall be so. <END>
you common cry of curs! whose breath i hate <END>
as reek o' the rotten fens, whose loves i prize <END>
as the dead carcasses of unburied men <END>
that do corrupt my air, i banish you; <END>
and here remain with your uncertainty! <END>
let every feeble rumour shake your hearts! <END>
your enemies, with nodding of their plumes, <END>
fan you into despair! have the power still <END>
to banish your defenders; till at length <END>
your ignorance, which finds not till it feels, <END>
making not reservation of yourselves, <END>
still your own foes, deliver you as most <END>
abated captives to some nation <END>
that won you without blows! despising, <END>
for you, the city, thus i turn my back: <END>
there is a world elsewhere. <END>
aedile: <END>
the people's enemy is gone, is gone! <END>
our enemy is banish'd! he is gone! hoo! hoo! <END>
go, see him out at gates, and follow him, <END>
as he hath followed you, with all despite; <END>
give him deserved vexation. let a guard <END>
attend us through the city. <END>
come, come; let's see him out at gates; come. <END>
the gods preserve our noble tribunes! come. <END>
come, leave your tears: a brief farewell: the beast <END>
with many heads butts me away. nay, mother, <END>
where is your ancient courage? you were used <END>
to say extremity was the trier of spirits; <END>
that common chances common men could bear; <END>
that when the sea was calm all boats alike <END>
show'd mastership in floating; fortune's blows, <END>
when most struck home, being gentle wounded, craves <END>
a noble cunning: you were used to load me <END>
with precepts that would make invincible <END>
the heart that conn'd them. <END>
o heavens! o heavens! <END>
nay! prithee, woman,-- <END>
now the red pestilence strike all trades in rome, <END>
and occupations perish! <END>
what, what, what! <END>
i shall be loved when i am lack'd. nay, mother. <END>
resume that spirit, when you were wont to say, <END>
if you had been the wife of hercules, <END>
six of his labours you'ld have done, and saved <END>
your husband so much sweat. cominius, <END>
droop not; adieu. farewell, my wife, my mother: <END>
i'll do well yet. thou old and true menenius, <END>
thy tears are salter than a younger man's, <END>
and venomous to thine eyes. my sometime general, <END>
i have seen thee stem, and thou hast oft beheld <END>
heart-hardening spectacles; tell these sad women <END>
'tis fond to wail inevitable strokes, <END>
as 'tis to laugh at 'em. my mother, you wot well <END>
my hazards still have been your solace: and <END>
believe't not lightly--though i go alone, <END>
like to a lonely dragon, that his fen <END>
makes fear'd and talk'd of more than seen--your son <END>
will or exceed the common or be caught <END>
with cautelous baits and practise. <END>
my first son. <END>
whither wilt thou go? take good cominius <END>
with thee awhile: determine on some course, <END>
more than a wild exposture to each chance <END>
that starts i' the way before thee. <END>
o the gods! <END>
i'll follow thee a month, devise with thee <END>
where thou shalt rest, that thou mayst hear of us <END>
and we of thee: so if the time thrust forth <END>
a cause for thy repeal, we shall not send <END>
o'er the vast world to seek a single man, <END>
and lose advantage, which doth ever cool <END>
i' the absence of the needer. <END>
fare ye well: <END>
thou hast years upon thee; and thou art too full <END>
of the wars' surfeits, to go rove with one <END>
that's yet unbruised: bring me but out at gate. <END>
come, my sweet wife, my dearest mother, and <END>
my friends of noble touch, when i am forth, <END>
bid me farewell, and smile. i pray you, come. <END>
while i remain above the ground, you shall <END>
hear from me still, and never of me aught <END>
but what is like me formerly. <END>
that's worthily <END>
as any ear can hear. come, let's not weep. <END>
if i could shake off but one seven years <END>
from these old arms and legs, by the good gods, <END>
i'ld with thee every foot. <END>
give me thy hand: come. <END>
bid them all home; he's gone, and we'll no further. <END>
the nobility are vex'd, whom we see have sided <END>
in his behalf. <END>
now we have shown our power, <END>
let us seem humbler after it is done <END>
than when it was a-doing. <END>
bid them home: <END>
say their great enemy is gone, and they <END>
stand in their ancient strength. <END>
dismiss them home. <END>
here comes his mother. <END>
let's not meet her. <END>
why? <END>
they say she's mad. <END>
they have ta'en note of us: keep on your way. <END>
o, ye're well met: the hoarded plague o' the gods <END>
requite your love! <END>
peace, peace; be not so loud. <END>
if that i could for weeping, you should hear,-- <END>
nay, and you shall hear some. <END>
will you be gone? <END>
are you mankind? <END>
ay, fool; is that a shame? note but this fool. <END>
was not a man my father? hadst thou foxship <END>
to banish him that struck more blows for rome <END>
than thou hast spoken words? <END>
o blessed heavens! <END>
more noble blows than ever thou wise words; <END>
and for rome's good. i'll tell thee what; yet go: <END>
nay, but thou shalt stay too: i would my son <END>
were in arabia, and thy tribe before him, <END>
his good sword in his hand. <END>
what then? <END>
what then! <END>
he'ld make an end of thy posterity. <END>
bastards and all. <END>
good man, the wounds that he does bear for rome! <END>
come, come, peace. <END>
i would he had continued to his country <END>
as he began, and not unknit himself <END>
the noble knot he made. <END>
i would he had. <END>
'i would he had'! 'twas you incensed the rabble: <END>
cats, that can judge as fitly of his worth <END>
as i can of those mysteries which heaven <END>
will not have earth to know. <END>
pray, let us go. <END>
now, pray, sir, get you gone: <END>
you have done a brave deed. ere you go, hear this:-- <END>
as far as doth the capitol exceed <END>
the meanest house in rome, so far my son-- <END>
this lady's husband here, this, do you see-- <END>
whom you have banish'd, does exceed you all. <END>
well, well, we'll leave you. <END>
why stay we to be baited <END>
with one that wants her wits? <END>
take my prayers with you. <END>
i would the gods had nothing else to do <END>
but to confirm my curses! could i meet 'em <END>
but once a-day, it would unclog my heart <END>
of what lies heavy to't. <END>
you have told them home; <END>
and, by my troth, you have cause. you'll sup with me? <END>
anger's my meat; i sup upon myself, <END>
and so shall starve with feeding. come, let's go: <END>
leave this faint puling and lament as i do, <END>
in anger, juno-like. come, come, come. <END>
fie, fie, fie! <END>
i know you well, sir, and you know <END>
me: your name, i think, is adrian. <END>
it is so, sir: truly, i have forgot you. <END>
i am a roman; and my services are, <END>
as you are, against 'em: know you me yet? <END>
nicanor? no. <END>
the same, sir. <END>
you had more beard when i last saw you; but your <END>
favour is well approved by your tongue. what's the <END>
news in rome? i have a note from the volscian state, <END>
to find you out there: you have well saved me a <END>
day's journey. <END>
there hath been in rome strange insurrections; the <END>
people against the senators, patricians, and nobles. <END>
hath been! is it ended, then? our state thinks not <END>
so: they are in a most warlike preparation, and <END>
hope to come upon them in the heat of their division. <END>
the main blaze of it is past, but a small thing <END>
would make it flame again: for the nobles receive <END>
so to heart the banishment of that worthy <END>
coriolanus, that they are in a ripe aptness to take <END>
all power from the people and to pluck from them <END>
their tribunes for ever. this lies glowing, i can <END>
tell you, and is almost mature for the violent <END>
breaking out. <END>
coriolanus banished! <END>
banished, sir. <END>
you will be welcome with this intelligence, nicanor. <END>
the day serves well for them now. i have heard it <END>
said, the fittest time to corrupt a man's wife is <END>
when she's fallen out with her husband. your noble <END>
tullus aufidius will appear well in these wars, his <END>
great opposer, coriolanus, being now in no request <END>
of his country. <END>
he cannot choose. i am most fortunate, thus <END>
accidentally to encounter you: you have ended my <END>
business, and i will merrily accompany you home. <END>
i shall, between this and supper, tell you most <END>
strange things from rome; all tending to the good of <END>
their adversaries. have you an army ready, say you? <END>
a most royal one; the centurions and their charges, <END>
distinctly billeted, already in the entertainment, <END>
and to be on foot at an hour's warning. <END>
i am joyful to hear of their readiness, and am the <END>
man, i think, that shall set them in present action. <END>
so, sir, heartily well met, and most glad of your company. <END>
you take my part from me, sir; i have the most cause <END>
to be glad of yours. <END>
well, let us go together. <END>
a goodly city is this antium. city, <END>
'tis i that made thy widows: many an heir <END>
of these fair edifices 'fore my wars <END>
have i heard groan and drop: then know me not, <END>
lest that thy wives with spits and boys with stones <END>
in puny battle slay me. <END>
save you, sir. <END>
and you. <END>
direct me, if it be your will, <END>
where great aufidius lies: is he in antium? <END>
he is, and feasts the nobles of the state <END>
at his house this night. <END>
which is his house, beseech you? <END>
this, here before you. <END>
thank you, sir: farewell. <END>
o world, thy slippery turns! friends now fast sworn, <END>
whose double bosoms seem to wear one heart, <END>
whose house, whose bed, whose meal, and exercise, <END>
are still together, who twin, as 'twere, in love <END>
unseparable, shall within this hour, <END>
on a dissension of a doit, break out <END>
to bitterest enmity: so, fellest foes, <END>
whose passions and whose plots have broke their sleep, <END>
to take the one the other, by some chance, <END>
some trick not worth an egg, shall grow dear friends <END>
and interjoin their issues. so with me: <END>
my birth-place hate i, and my love's upon <END>
this enemy town. i'll enter: if he slay me, <END>
he does fair justice; if he give me way, <END>
i'll do his country service. <END>
wine, wine, wine! what service <END>
is here! i think our fellows are asleep. <END>
where's cotus? my master calls <END>
for him. cotus! <END>
a goodly house: the feast smells well; but i <END>
appear not like a guest. <END>
what would you have, friend? whence are you? <END>
here's no place for you: pray, go to the door. <END>
i have deserved no better entertainment, <END>
in being coriolanus. <END>
whence are you, sir? has the porter his eyes in his <END>
head; that he gives entrance to such companions? <END>
pray, get you out. <END>
away! <END>
away! get you away. <END>
now thou'rt troublesome. <END>
are you so brave? i'll have you talked with anon. <END>
what fellow's this? <END>
a strange one as ever i looked on: i cannot get him <END>
out of the house: prithee, call my master to him. <END>
what have you to do here, fellow? pray you, avoid <END>
the house. <END>
let me but stand; i will not hurt your hearth. <END>
what are you? <END>
a gentleman. <END>
a marvellous poor one. <END>
true, so i am. <END>
pray you, poor gentleman, take up some other <END>
station; here's no place for you; pray you, avoid: come. <END>
follow your function, go, and batten on cold bits. <END>
what, you will not? prithee, tell my master what a <END>
strange guest he has here. <END>
and i shall. <END>
where dwellest thou? <END>
under the canopy. <END>
under the canopy! <END>
ay. <END>
where's that? <END>
i' the city of kites and crows. <END>
i' the city of kites and crows! what an ass it is! <END>
then thou dwellest with daws too? <END>
no, i serve not thy master. <END>
how, sir! do you meddle with my master? <END>
ay; 'tis an honester service than to meddle with thy <END>
mistress. thou pratest, and pratest; serve with thy <END>
trencher, hence! <END>
where is this fellow? <END>
here, sir: i'ld have beaten him like a dog, but for <END>
disturbing the lords within. <END>
whence comest thou? what wouldst thou? thy name? <END>
why speak'st not? speak, man: what's thy name? <END>
if, tullus, <END>
not yet thou knowest me, and, seeing me, dost not <END>
think me for the man i am, necessity <END>
commands me name myself. <END>
what is thy name? <END>
a name unmusical to the volscians' ears, <END>
and harsh in sound to thine. <END>
say, what's thy name? <END>
thou hast a grim appearance, and thy face <END>
bears a command in't; though thy tackle's torn. <END>
thou show'st a noble vessel: what's thy name? <END>
prepare thy brow to frown: know'st <END>
thou me yet? <END>
i know thee not: thy name? <END>
my name is caius marcius, who hath done <END>
to thee particularly and to all the volsces <END>
great hurt and mischief; thereto witness may <END>
my surname, coriolanus: the painful service, <END>
the extreme dangers and the drops of blood <END>
shed for my thankless country are requited <END>
but with that surname; a good memory, <END>
and witness of the malice and displeasure <END>
which thou shouldst bear me: only that name remains; <END>
the cruelty and envy of the people, <END>
permitted by our dastard nobles, who <END>
have all forsook me, hath devour'd the rest; <END>
and suffer'd me by the voice of slaves to be <END>
whoop'd out of rome. now this extremity <END>
hath brought me to thy hearth; not out of hope-- <END>
mistake me not--to save my life, for if <END>
i had fear'd death, of all the men i' the world <END>
i would have 'voided thee, but in mere spite, <END>
to be full quit of those my banishers, <END>
stand i before thee here. then if thou hast <END>
a heart of wreak in thee, that wilt revenge <END>
thine own particular wrongs and stop those maims <END>
of shame seen through thy country, speed <END>
thee straight, <END>
and make my misery serve thy turn: so use it <END>
that my revengeful services may prove <END>
as benefits to thee, for i will fight <END>
against my canker'd country with the spleen <END>
of all the under fiends. but if so be <END>
thou darest not this and that to prove more fortunes <END>
thou'rt tired, then, in a word, i also am <END>
longer to live most weary, and present <END>
my throat to thee and to thy ancient malice; <END>
which not to cut would show thee but a fool, <END>
since i have ever follow'd thee with hate, <END>
drawn tuns of blood out of thy country's breast, <END>
and cannot live but to thy shame, unless <END>
it be to do thee service. <END>
o marcius, marcius! <END>
each word thou hast spoke hath weeded from my heart <END>
a root of ancient envy. if jupiter <END>
should from yond cloud speak divine things, <END>
and say 'tis true,' i'ld not believe them more <END>
than thee, all noble marcius. let me twine <END>
mine arms about that body, where against <END>
my grained ash an hundred times hath broke <END>
and scarr'd the moon with splinters: here i clip <END>
the anvil of my sword, and do contest <END>
as hotly and as nobly with thy love <END>
as ever in ambitious strength i did <END>
contend against thy valour. know thou first, <END>
i loved the maid i married; never man <END>
sigh'd truer breath; but that i see thee here, <END>
thou noble thing! more dances my rapt heart <END>
than when i first my wedded mistress saw <END>
bestride my threshold. why, thou mars! i tell thee, <END>
we have a power on foot; and i had purpose <END>
once more to hew thy target from thy brawn, <END>
or lose mine arm fort: thou hast beat me out <END>
twelve several times, and i have nightly since <END>
dreamt of encounters 'twixt thyself and me; <END>
we have been down together in my sleep, <END>
unbuckling helms, fisting each other's throat, <END>
and waked half dead with nothing. worthy marcius, <END>
had we no quarrel else to rome, but that <END>
thou art thence banish'd, we would muster all <END>
from twelve to seventy, and pouring war <END>
into the bowels of ungrateful rome, <END>
like a bold flood o'er-bear. o, come, go in, <END>
and take our friendly senators by the hands; <END>
who now are here, taking their leaves of me, <END>
who am prepared against your territories, <END>
though not for rome itself. <END>
you bless me, gods! <END>
therefore, most absolute sir, if thou wilt have <END>
the leading of thine own revenges, take <END>
the one half of my commission; and set down-- <END>
as best thou art experienced, since thou know'st <END>
thy country's strength and weakness,--thine own ways; <END>
whether to knock against the gates of rome, <END>
or rudely visit them in parts remote, <END>
to fright them, ere destroy. but come in: <END>
let me commend thee first to those that shall <END>
say yea to thy desires. a thousand welcomes! <END>
and more a friend than e'er an enemy; <END>
yet, marcius, that was much. your hand: most welcome! <END>
here's a strange alteration! <END>
by my hand, i had thought to have strucken him with <END>
a cudgel; and yet my mind gave me his clothes made a <END>
false report of him. <END>
what an arm he has! he turned me about with his <END>
finger and his thumb, as one would set up a top. <END>
nay, i knew by his face that there was something in <END>
him: he had, sir, a kind of face, methought,--i <END>
cannot tell how to term it. <END>
he had so; looking as it were--would i were hanged, <END>
but i thought there was more in him than i could think. <END>
so did i, i'll be sworn: he is simply the rarest <END>
man i' the world. <END>
i think he is: but a greater soldier than he you wot on. <END>
who, my master? <END>
nay, it's no matter for that. <END>
worth six on him. <END>
nay, not so neither: but i take him to be the <END>
greater soldier. <END>
faith, look you, one cannot tell how to say that: <END>
for the defence of a town, our general is excellent. <END>
ay, and for an assault too. <END>
o slaves, i can tell you news,-- news, you rascals! <END>
what, what, what? let's partake. <END>
i would not be a roman, of all nations; i had as <END>
lieve be a condemned man. <END>
wherefore? wherefore? <END>
why, here's he that was wont to thwack our general, <END>
caius marcius. <END>
why do you say 'thwack our general '? <END>
i do not say 'thwack our general;' but he was always <END>
good enough for him. <END>
come, we are fellows and friends: he was ever too <END>
hard for him; i have heard him say so himself. <END>
he was too hard for him directly, to say the troth <END>
on't: before corioli he scotched him and notched <END>
him like a carbon ado. <END>
an he had been cannibally given, he might have <END>
broiled and eaten him too. <END>
but, more of thy news? <END>
why, he is so made on here within, as if he were son <END>
and heir to mars; set at upper end o' the table; no <END>
question asked him by any of the senators, but they <END>
stand bald before him: our general himself makes a <END>
mistress of him: sanctifies himself with's hand and <END>
turns up the white o' the eye to his discourse. but <END>
the bottom of the news is that our general is cut i' <END>
the middle and but one half of what he was <END>
yesterday; for the other has half, by the entreaty <END>
and grant of the whole table. he'll go, he says, <END>
and sowl the porter of rome gates by the ears: he <END>
will mow all down before him, and leave his passage polled. <END>
and he's as like to do't as any man i can imagine. <END>
do't! he will do't; for, look you, sir, he has as <END>
many friends as enemies; which friends, sir, as it <END>
were, durst not, look you, sir, show themselves, as <END>
we term it, his friends whilst he's in directitude. <END>
directitude! what's that? <END>
but when they shall see, sir, his crest up again, <END>
and the man in blood, they will out of their <END>
burrows, like conies after rain, and revel all with <END>
him. <END>
but when goes this forward? <END>
to-morrow; to-day; presently; you shall have the <END>
drum struck up this afternoon: 'tis, as it were, a <END>
parcel of their feast, and to be executed ere they <END>
wipe their lips. <END>
why, then we shall have a stirring world again. <END>
this peace is nothing, but to rust iron, increase <END>
tailors, and breed ballad-makers. <END>
let me have war, say i; it exceeds peace as far as <END>
day does night; it's spritely, waking, audible, and <END>
full of vent. peace is a very apoplexy, lethargy; <END>
mulled, deaf, sleepy, insensible; a getter of more <END>
bastard children than war's a destroyer of men. <END>
'tis so: and as war, in some sort, may be said to <END>
be a ravisher, so it cannot be denied but peace is a <END>
great maker of cuckolds. <END>
ay, and it makes men hate one another. <END>
reason; because they then less need one another. <END>
the wars for my money. i hope to see romans as cheap <END>
as volscians. they are rising, they are rising. <END>
in, in, in, in! <END>
we hear not of him, neither need we fear him; <END>
his remedies are tame i' the present peace <END>
and quietness of the people, which before <END>
were in wild hurry. here do we make his friends <END>
blush that the world goes well, who rather had, <END>
though they themselves did suffer by't, behold <END>
dissentious numbers pestering streets than see <END>
our tradesmen with in their shops and going <END>
about their functions friendly. <END>
we stood to't in good time. <END>
is this menenius? <END>
'tis he,'tis he: o, he is grown most kind of late. <END>
hail sir! <END>
hail to you both! <END>
your coriolanus <END>
is not much miss'd, but with his friends: <END>
the commonwealth doth stand, and so would do, <END>
were he more angry at it. <END>
all's well; and might have been much better, if <END>
he could have temporized. <END>
where is he, hear you? <END>
nay, i hear nothing: his mother and his wife <END>
hear nothing from him. <END>
the gods preserve you both! <END>
god-den, our neighbours. <END>
god-den to you all, god-den to you all. <END>
ourselves, our wives, and children, on our knees, <END>
are bound to pray for you both. <END>
live, and thrive! <END>
farewell, kind neighbours: we wish'd coriolanus <END>
had loved you as we did. <END>
now the gods keep you! <END>
farewell, farewell. <END>
this is a happier and more comely time <END>
than when these fellows ran about the streets, <END>
crying confusion. <END>
caius marcius was <END>
a worthy officer i' the war; but insolent, <END>
o'ercome with pride, ambitious past all thinking, <END>
self-loving,-- <END>
and affecting one sole throne, <END>
without assistance. <END>
i think not so. <END>
we should by this, to all our lamentation, <END>
if he had gone forth consul, found it so. <END>
the gods have well prevented it, and rome <END>
sits safe and still without him. <END>
aedile: <END>
worthy tribunes, <END>
there is a slave, whom we have put in prison, <END>
reports, the volsces with two several powers <END>
are enter'd in the roman territories, <END>
and with the deepest malice of the war <END>
destroy what lies before 'em. <END>
'tis aufidius, <END>
who, hearing of our marcius' banishment, <END>
thrusts forth his horns again into the world; <END>
which were inshell'd when marcius stood for rome, <END>
and durst not once peep out. <END>
come, what talk you <END>
of marcius? <END>
go see this rumourer whipp'd. it cannot be <END>
the volsces dare break with us. <END>
cannot be! <END>
we have record that very well it can, <END>
and three examples of the like have been <END>
within my age. but reason with the fellow, <END>
before you punish him, where he heard this, <END>
lest you shall chance to whip your information <END>
and beat the messenger who bids beware <END>
of what is to be dreaded. <END>
tell not me: <END>
i know this cannot be. <END>
not possible. <END>
the nobles in great earnestness are going <END>
all to the senate-house: some news is come <END>
that turns their countenances. <END>
'tis this slave;-- <END>
go whip him, 'fore the people's eyes:--his raising; <END>
nothing but his report. <END>
yes, worthy sir, <END>
the slave's report is seconded; and more, <END>
more fearful, is deliver'd. <END>
what more fearful? <END>
it is spoke freely out of many mouths-- <END>
how probable i do not know--that marcius, <END>
join'd with aufidius, leads a power 'gainst rome, <END>
and vows revenge as spacious as between <END>
the young'st and oldest thing. <END>
this is most likely! <END>
raised only, that the weaker sort may wish <END>
good marcius home again. <END>
the very trick on't. <END>
this is unlikely: <END>
he and aufidius can no more atone <END>
than violentest contrariety. <END>
you are sent for to the senate: <END>
a fearful army, led by caius marcius <END>
associated with aufidius, rages <END>
upon our territories; and have already <END>
o'erborne their way, consumed with fire, and took <END>
what lay before them. <END>
o, you have made good work! <END>
what news? what news? <END>
you have holp to ravish your own daughters and <END>
to melt the city leads upon your pates, <END>
to see your wives dishonour'd to your noses,-- <END>
what's the news? what's the news? <END>
your temples burned in their cement, and <END>
your franchises, whereon you stood, confined <END>
into an auger's bore. <END>
pray now, your news? <END>
you have made fair work, i fear me.--pray, your news?-- <END>
if marcius should be join'd with volscians,-- <END>
if! <END>
he is their god: he leads them like a thing <END>
made by some other deity than nature, <END>
that shapes man better; and they follow him, <END>
against us brats, with no less confidence <END>
than boys pursuing summer butterflies, <END>
or butchers killing flies. <END>
you have made good work, <END>
you and your apron-men; you that stood so up much <END>
on the voice of occupation and <END>
the breath of garlic-eaters! <END>
he will shake <END>
your rome about your ears. <END>
as hercules <END>
did shake down mellow fruit. <END>
you have made fair work! <END>
but is this true, sir? <END>
ay; and you'll look pale <END>
before you find it other. all the regions <END>
do smilingly revolt; and who resist <END>
are mock'd for valiant ignorance, <END>
and perish constant fools. who is't can blame him? <END>
your enemies and his find something in him. <END>
we are all undone, unless <END>
the noble man have mercy. <END>
who shall ask it? <END>
the tribunes cannot do't for shame; the people <END>
deserve such pity of him as the wolf <END>
does of the shepherds: for his best friends, if they <END>
should say 'be good to rome,' they charged him even <END>
as those should do that had deserved his hate, <END>
and therein show'd like enemies. <END>
'tis true: <END>
if he were putting to my house the brand <END>
that should consume it, i have not the face <END>
to say 'beseech you, cease.' you have made fair hands, <END>
you and your crafts! you have crafted fair! <END>
you have brought <END>
a trembling upon rome, such as was never <END>
so incapable of help. <END>
say not we brought it. <END>
how! was it we? we loved him but, like beasts <END>
and cowardly nobles, gave way unto your clusters, <END>
who did hoot him out o' the city. <END>
but i fear <END>
they'll roar him in again. tullus aufidius, <END>
the second name of men, obeys his points <END>
as if he were his officer: desperation <END>
is all the policy, strength and defence, <END>
that rome can make against them. <END>
here come the clusters. <END>
and is aufidius with him? you are they <END>
that made the air unwholesome, when you cast <END>
your stinking greasy caps in hooting at <END>
coriolanus' exile. now he's coming; <END>
and not a hair upon a soldier's head <END>
which will not prove a whip: as many coxcombs <END>
as you threw caps up will he tumble down, <END>
and pay you for your voices. 'tis no matter; <END>
if he could burn us all into one coal, <END>
we have deserved it. <END>
faith, we hear fearful news. <END>
for mine own part, <END>
when i said, banish him, i said 'twas pity. <END>
and so did i. <END>
and so did i; and, to say the truth, so did very <END>
many of us: that we did, we did for the best; and <END>
though we willingly consented to his banishment, yet <END>
it was against our will. <END>
ye re goodly things, you voices! <END>
you have made <END>
good work, you and your cry! shall's to the capitol? <END>
o, ay, what else? <END>
go, masters, get you home; be not dismay'd: <END>
these are a side that would be glad to have <END>
this true which they so seem to fear. go home, <END>
and show no sign of fear. <END>
the gods be good to us! come, masters, let's home. <END>
i ever said we were i' the wrong when we banished <END>
him. <END>
so did we all. but, come, let's home. <END>
i do not like this news. <END>
nor i. <END>
let's to the capitol. would half my wealth <END>
would buy this for a lie! <END>
pray, let us go. <END>
do they still fly to the roman? <END>
i do not know what witchcraft's in him, but <END>
your soldiers use him as the grace 'fore meat, <END>
their talk at table, and their thanks at end; <END>
and you are darken'd in this action, sir, <END>
even by your own. <END>
i cannot help it now, <END>
unless, by using means, i lame the foot <END>
of our design. he bears himself more proudlier, <END>
even to my person, than i thought he would <END>
when first i did embrace him: yet his nature <END>
in that's no changeling; and i must excuse <END>
what cannot be amended. <END>
yet i wish, sir,-- <END>
i mean for your particular,--you had not <END>
join'd in commission with him; but either <END>
had borne the action of yourself, or else <END>
to him had left it solely. <END>
i understand thee well; and be thou sure, <END>
when he shall come to his account, he knows not <END>
what i can urge against him. although it seems, <END>
and so he thinks, and is no less apparent <END>
to the vulgar eye, that he bears all things fairly. <END>
and shows good husbandry for the volscian state, <END>
fights dragon-like, and does achieve as soon <END>
as draw his sword; yet he hath left undone <END>
that which shall break his neck or hazard mine, <END>
whene'er we come to our account. <END>
sir, i beseech you, think you he'll carry rome? <END>
all places yield to him ere he sits down; <END>
and the nobility of rome are his: <END>
the senators and patricians love him too: <END>
the tribunes are no soldiers; and their people <END>
will be as rash in the repeal, as hasty <END>
to expel him thence. i think he'll be to rome <END>
as is the osprey to the fish, who takes it <END>
by sovereignty of nature. first he was <END>
a noble servant to them; but he could not <END>
carry his honours even: whether 'twas pride, <END>
which out of daily fortune ever taints <END>
the happy man; whether defect of judgment, <END>
to fail in the disposing of those chances <END>
which he was lord of; or whether nature, <END>
not to be other than one thing, not moving <END>
from the casque to the cushion, but commanding peace <END>
even with the same austerity and garb <END>
as he controll'd the war; but one of these-- <END>
as he hath spices of them all, not all, <END>
for i dare so far free him--made him fear'd, <END>
so hated, and so banish'd: but he has a merit, <END>
to choke it in the utterance. so our virtues <END>
lie in the interpretation of the time: <END>
and power, unto itself most commendable, <END>
hath not a tomb so evident as a chair <END>
to extol what it hath done. <END>
one fire drives out one fire; one nail, one nail; <END>
rights by rights falter, strengths by strengths do fail. <END>
come, let's away. when, caius, rome is thine, <END>
thou art poor'st of all; then shortly art thou mine. <END>
no, i'll not go: you hear what he hath said <END>
which was sometime his general; who loved him <END>
in a most dear particular. he call'd me father: <END>
but what o' that? go, you that banish'd him; <END>
a mile before his tent fall down, and knee <END>
the way into his mercy: nay, if he coy'd <END>
to hear cominius speak, i'll keep at home. <END>
he would not seem to know me. <END>
do you hear? <END>
yet one time he did call me by my name: <END>
i urged our old acquaintance, and the drops <END>
that we have bled together. coriolanus <END>
he would not answer to: forbad all names; <END>
he was a kind of nothing, titleless, <END>
till he had forged himself a name o' the fire <END>
of burning rome. <END>
why, so: you have made good work! <END>
a pair of tribunes that have rack'd for rome, <END>
to make coals cheap,--a noble memory! <END>
i minded him how royal 'twas to pardon <END>
when it was less expected: he replied, <END>
it was a bare petition of a state <END>
to one whom they had punish'd. <END>
very well: <END>
could he say less? <END>
i offer'd to awaken his regard <END>
for's private friends: his answer to me was, <END>
he could not stay to pick them in a pile <END>
of noisome musty chaff: he said 'twas folly, <END>
for one poor grain or two, to leave unburnt, <END>
and still to nose the offence. <END>
for one poor grain or two! <END>
i am one of those; his mother, wife, his child, <END>
and this brave fellow too, we are the grains: <END>
you are the musty chaff; and you are smelt <END>
above the moon: we must be burnt for you. <END>
nay, pray, be patient: if you refuse your aid <END>
in this so never-needed help, yet do not <END>
upbraid's with our distress. but, sure, if you <END>
would be your country's pleader, your good tongue, <END>
more than the instant army we can make, <END>
might stop our countryman. <END>
no, i'll not meddle. <END>
pray you, go to him. <END>
what should i do? <END>
only make trial what your love can do <END>
for rome, towards marcius. <END>
well, and say that marcius <END>
return me, as cominius is return'd, <END>
unheard; what then? <END>
but as a discontented friend, grief-shot <END>
with his unkindness? say't be so? <END>
yet your good will <END>
must have that thanks from rome, after the measure <END>
as you intended well. <END>
i'll undertake 't: <END>
i think he'll hear me. yet, to bite his lip <END>
and hum at good cominius, much unhearts me. <END>
he was not taken well; he had not dined: <END>
the veins unfill'd, our blood is cold, and then <END>
we pout upon the morning, are unapt <END>
to give or to forgive; but when we have stuff'd <END>
these and these conveyances of our blood <END>
with wine and feeding, we have suppler souls <END>
than in our priest-like fasts: therefore i'll watch him <END>
till he be dieted to my request, <END>
and then i'll set upon him. <END>
you know the very road into his kindness, <END>
and cannot lose your way. <END>
good faith, i'll prove him, <END>
speed how it will. i shall ere long have knowledge <END>
of my success. <END>
he'll never hear him. <END>
not? <END>
i tell you, he does sit in gold, his eye <END>
red as 'twould burn rome; and his injury <END>
the gaoler to his pity. i kneel'd before him; <END>
'twas very faintly he said 'rise;' dismiss'd me <END>
thus, with his speechless hand: what he would do, <END>
he sent in writing after me; what he would not, <END>
bound with an oath to yield to his conditions: <END>
so that all hope is vain. <END>
unless his noble mother, and his wife; <END>
who, as i hear, mean to solicit him <END>
for mercy to his country. therefore, let's hence, <END>
and with our fair entreaties haste them on. <END>
stand, and go back. <END>
you guard like men; 'tis well: but, by your leave, <END>
i am an officer of state, and come <END>
to speak with coriolanus. <END>
from whence? <END>
from rome. <END>
you may not pass, you must return: our general <END>
will no more hear from thence. <END>
you'll see your rome embraced with fire before <END>
you'll speak with coriolanus. <END>
good my friends, <END>
if you have heard your general talk of rome, <END>
and of his friends there, it is lots to blanks, <END>
my name hath touch'd your ears it is menenius. <END>
be it so; go back: the virtue of your name <END>
is not here passable. <END>
i tell thee, fellow, <END>
the general is my lover: i have been <END>
the book of his good acts, whence men have read <END>
his name unparallel'd, haply amplified; <END>
for i have ever verified my friends, <END>
of whom he's chief, with all the size that verity <END>
would without lapsing suffer: nay, sometimes, <END>
like to a bowl upon a subtle ground, <END>
i have tumbled past the throw; and in his praise <END>
have almost stamp'd the leasing: therefore, fellow, <END>
i must have leave to pass. <END>
faith, sir, if you had told as many lies in his <END>
behalf as you have uttered words in your own, you <END>
should not pass here; no, though it were as virtuous <END>
to lie as to live chastely. therefore, go back. <END>
prithee, fellow, remember my name is menenius, <END>
always factionary on the party of your general. <END>
howsoever you have been his liar, as you say you <END>
have, i am one that, telling true under him, must <END>
say, you cannot pass. therefore, go back. <END>
has he dined, canst thou tell? for i would not <END>
speak with him till after dinner. <END>
you are a roman, are you? <END>
i am, as thy general is. <END>
then you should hate rome, as he does. can you, <END>
when you have pushed out your gates the very <END>
defender of them, and, in a violent popular <END>
ignorance, given your enemy your shield, think to <END>
front his revenges with the easy groans of old <END>
women, the virginal palms of your daughters, or with <END>
the palsied intercession of such a decayed dotant as <END>
you seem to be? can you think to blow out the <END>
intended fire your city is ready to flame in, with <END>
such weak breath as this? no, you are deceived; <END>
therefore, back to rome, and prepare for your <END>
execution: you are condemned, our general has sworn <END>
you out of reprieve and pardon. <END>
sirrah, if thy captain knew i were here, he would <END>
use me with estimation. <END>
come, my captain knows you not. <END>
i mean, thy general. <END>
my general cares not for you. back, i say, go; lest <END>
i let forth your half-pint of blood; back,--that's <END>
the utmost of your having: back. <END>
nay, but, fellow, fellow,-- <END>
what's the matter? <END>
now, you companion, i'll say an errand for you: <END>
you shall know now that i am in estimation; you shall <END>
perceive that a jack guardant cannot office me from <END>
my son coriolanus: guess, but by my entertainment <END>
with him, if thou standest not i' the state of <END>
hanging, or of some death more long in <END>
spectatorship, and crueller in suffering; behold now <END>
presently, and swoon for what's to come upon thee. <END>
the glorious gods sit in hourly synod about thy <END>
particular prosperity, and love thee no worse than <END>
thy old father menenius does! o my son, my son! <END>
thou art preparing fire for us; look thee, here's <END>
water to quench it. i was hardly moved to come to <END>
thee; but being assured none but myself could move <END>
thee, i have been blown out of your gates with <END>
sighs; and conjure thee to pardon rome, and thy <END>
petitionary countrymen. the good gods assuage thy <END>
wrath, and turn the dregs of it upon this varlet <END>
here,--this, who, like a block, hath denied my <END>
access to thee. <END>
away! <END>
how! away! <END>
wife, mother, child, i know not. my affairs <END>
are servanted to others: though i owe <END>
my revenge properly, my remission lies <END>
in volscian breasts. that we have been familiar, <END>
ingrate forgetfulness shall poison, rather <END>
than pity note how much. therefore, be gone. <END>
mine ears against your suits are stronger than <END>
your gates against my force. yet, for i loved thee, <END>
take this along; i writ it for thy sake <END>
and would have rent it. another word, menenius, <END>
i will not hear thee speak. this man, aufidius, <END>
was my beloved in rome: yet thou behold'st! <END>
you keep a constant temper. <END>
now, sir, is your name menenius? <END>
'tis a spell, you see, of much power: you know the <END>
way home again. <END>
do you hear how we are shent for keeping your <END>
greatness back? <END>
what cause, do you think, i have to swoon? <END>
i neither care for the world nor your general: for <END>
such things as you, i can scarce think there's any, <END>
ye're so slight. he that hath a will to die by <END>
himself fears it not from another: let your general <END>
do his worst. for you, be that you are, long; and <END>
your misery increase with your age! i say to you, <END>
as i was said to, away! <END>
a noble fellow, i warrant him. <END>
the worthy fellow is our general: he's the rock, the <END>
oak not to be wind-shaken. <END>
we will before the walls of rome tomorrow <END>
set down our host. my partner in this action, <END>
you must report to the volscian lords, how plainly <END>
i have borne this business. <END>
only their ends <END>
you have respected; stopp'd your ears against <END>
the general suit of rome; never admitted <END>
a private whisper, no, not with such friends <END>
that thought them sure of you. <END>
this last old man, <END>
whom with a crack'd heart i have sent to rome, <END>
loved me above the measure of a father; <END>
nay, godded me, indeed. their latest refuge <END>
was to send him; for whose old love i have, <END>
though i show'd sourly to him, once more offer'd <END>
the first conditions, which they did refuse <END>
and cannot now accept; to grace him only <END>
that thought he could do more, a very little <END>
i have yielded to: fresh embassies and suits, <END>
nor from the state nor private friends, hereafter <END>
will i lend ear to. ha! what shout is this? <END>
shall i be tempted to infringe my vow <END>
in the same time 'tis made? i will not. <END>
my wife comes foremost; then the honour'd mould <END>
wherein this trunk was framed, and in her hand <END>
the grandchild to her blood. but, out, affection! <END>
all bond and privilege of nature, break! <END>
let it be virtuous to be obstinate. <END>
what is that curt'sy worth? or those doves' eyes, <END>
which can make gods forsworn? i melt, and am not <END>
of stronger earth than others. my mother bows; <END>
as if olympus to a molehill should <END>
in supplication nod: and my young boy <END>
hath an aspect of intercession, which <END>
great nature cries 'deny not.' let the volsces <END>
plough rome and harrow italy: i'll never <END>
be such a gosling to obey instinct, but stand, <END>
as if a man were author of himself <END>
and knew no other kin. <END>
my lord and husband! <END>
these eyes are not the same i wore in rome. <END>
the sorrow that delivers us thus changed <END>
makes you think so. <END>
like a dull actor now, <END>
i have forgot my part, and i am out, <END>
even to a full disgrace. best of my flesh, <END>
forgive my tyranny; but do not say <END>
for that 'forgive our romans.' o, a kiss <END>
long as my exile, sweet as my revenge! <END>
now, by the jealous queen of heaven, that kiss <END>
i carried from thee, dear; and my true lip <END>
hath virgin'd it e'er since. you gods! i prate, <END>
and the most noble mother of the world <END>
leave unsaluted: sink, my knee, i' the earth; <END>
of thy deep duty more impression show <END>
than that of common sons. <END>
o, stand up blest! <END>
whilst, with no softer cushion than the flint, <END>
i kneel before thee; and unproperly <END>
show duty, as mistaken all this while <END>
between the child and parent. <END>
what is this? <END>
your knees to me? to your corrected son? <END>
then let the pebbles on the hungry beach <END>
fillip the stars; then let the mutinous winds <END>
strike the proud cedars 'gainst the fiery sun; <END>
murdering impossibility, to make <END>
what cannot be, slight work. <END>
thou art my warrior; <END>
i holp to frame thee. do you know this lady? <END>
the noble sister of publicola, <END>
the moon of rome, chaste as the icicle <END>
that's curdied by the frost from purest snow <END>
and hangs on dian's temple: dear valeria! <END>
this is a poor epitome of yours, <END>
which by the interpretation of full time <END>
may show like all yourself. <END>
the god of soldiers, <END>
with the consent of supreme jove, inform <END>
thy thoughts with nobleness; that thou mayst prove <END>
to shame unvulnerable, and stick i' the wars <END>
like a great sea-mark, standing every flaw, <END>
and saving those that eye thee! <END>
your knee, sirrah. <END>
that's my brave boy! <END>
even he, your wife, this lady, and myself, <END>
are suitors to you. <END>
i beseech you, peace: <END>
or, if you'ld ask, remember this before: <END>
the thing i have forsworn to grant may never <END>
be held by you denials. do not bid me <END>
dismiss my soldiers, or capitulate <END>
again with rome's mechanics: tell me not <END>
wherein i seem unnatural: desire not <END>
to ally my rages and revenges with <END>
your colder reasons. <END>
o, no more, no more! <END>
you have said you will not grant us any thing; <END>
for we have nothing else to ask, but that <END>
which you deny already: yet we will ask; <END>
that, if you fail in our request, the blame <END>
may hang upon your hardness: therefore hear us. <END>
aufidius, and you volsces, mark; for we'll <END>
hear nought from rome in private. your request? <END>
should we be silent and not speak, our raiment <END>
and state of bodies would bewray what life <END>
we have led since thy exile. think with thyself <END>
how more unfortunate than all living women <END>
are we come hither: since that thy sight, <END>
which should <END>
make our eyes flow with joy, hearts dance <END>
with comforts, <END>
constrains them weep and shake with fear and sorrow; <END>
making the mother, wife and child to see <END>
the son, the husband and the father tearing <END>
his country's bowels out. and to poor we <END>
thine enmity's most capital: thou barr'st us <END>
our prayers to the gods, which is a comfort <END>
that all but we enjoy; for how can we, <END>
alas, how can we for our country pray. <END>
whereto we are bound, together with thy victory, <END>
whereto we are bound? alack, or we must lose <END>
the country, our dear nurse, or else thy person, <END>
our comfort in the country. we must find <END>
an evident calamity, though we had <END>
our wish, which side should win: for either thou <END>
must, as a foreign recreant, be led <END>
with manacles thorough our streets, or else <END>
triumphantly tread on thy country's ruin, <END>
and bear the palm for having bravely shed <END>
thy wife and children's blood. for myself, son, <END>
i purpose not to wait on fortune till <END>
these wars determine: if i cannot persuade thee <END>
rather to show a noble grace to both parts <END>
than seek the end of one, thou shalt no sooner <END>
march to assault thy country than to tread-- <END>
trust to't, thou shalt not--on thy mother's womb, <END>
that brought thee to this world. <END>
ay, and mine, <END>
that brought you forth this boy, to keep your name <END>
living to time. <END>
young marcius: <END>
a' shall not tread on me; <END>
i'll run away till i am bigger, but then i'll fight. <END>
not of a woman's tenderness to be, <END>
requires nor child nor woman's face to see. <END>
i have sat too long. <END>
nay, go not from us thus. <END>
if it were so that our request did tend <END>
to save the romans, thereby to destroy <END>
the volsces whom you serve, you might condemn us, <END>
as poisonous of your honour: no; our suit <END>
is that you reconcile them: while the volsces <END>
may say 'this mercy we have show'd;' the romans, <END>
'this we received;' and each in either side <END>
give the all-hail to thee and cry 'be blest <END>
for making up this peace!' thou know'st, great son, <END>
the end of war's uncertain, but this certain, <END>
that, if thou conquer rome, the benefit <END>
which thou shalt thereby reap is such a name, <END>
whose repetition will be dogg'd with curses; <END>
whose chronicle thus writ: 'the man was noble, <END>
but with his last attempt he wiped it out; <END>
destroy'd his country, and his name remains <END>
to the ensuing age abhorr'd.' speak to me, son: <END>
thou hast affected the fine strains of honour, <END>
to imitate the graces of the gods; <END>
to tear with thunder the wide cheeks o' the air, <END>
and yet to charge thy sulphur with a bolt <END>
that should but rive an oak. why dost not speak? <END>
think'st thou it honourable for a noble man <END>
still to remember wrongs? daughter, speak you: <END>
he cares not for your weeping. speak thou, boy: <END>
perhaps thy childishness will move him more <END>
than can our reasons. there's no man in the world <END>
more bound to 's mother; yet here he lets me prate <END>
like one i' the stocks. thou hast never in thy life <END>
show'd thy dear mother any courtesy, <END>
when she, poor hen, fond of no second brood, <END>
has cluck'd thee to the wars and safely home, <END>
loaden with honour. say my request's unjust, <END>
and spurn me back: but if it be not so, <END>
thou art not honest; and the gods will plague thee, <END>
that thou restrain'st from me the duty which <END>
to a mother's part belongs. he turns away: <END>
down, ladies; let us shame him with our knees. <END>
to his surname coriolanus 'longs more pride <END>
than pity to our prayers. down: an end; <END>
this is the last: so we will home to rome, <END>
and die among our neighbours. nay, behold 's: <END>
this boy, that cannot tell what he would have <END>
but kneels and holds up bands for fellowship, <END>
does reason our petition with more strength <END>
than thou hast to deny 't. come, let us go: <END>
this fellow had a volscian to his mother; <END>
his wife is in corioli and his child <END>
like him by chance. yet give us our dispatch: <END>
i am hush'd until our city be a-fire, <END>
and then i'll speak a little. <END>
o mother, mother! <END>
what have you done? behold, the heavens do ope, <END>
the gods look down, and this unnatural scene <END>
they laugh at. o my mother, mother! o! <END>
you have won a happy victory to rome; <END>
but, for your son,--believe it, o, believe it, <END>
most dangerously you have with him prevail'd, <END>
if not most mortal to him. but, let it come. <END>
aufidius, though i cannot make true wars, <END>
i'll frame convenient peace. now, good aufidius, <END>
were you in my stead, would you have heard <END>
a mother less? or granted less, aufidius? <END>
i was moved withal. <END>
i dare be sworn you were: <END>
and, sir, it is no little thing to make <END>
mine eyes to sweat compassion. but, good sir, <END>
what peace you'll make, advise me: for my part, <END>
i'll not to rome, i'll back with you; and pray you, <END>
stand to me in this cause. o mother! wife! <END>
ay, by and by; <END>
but we will drink together; and you shall bear <END>
a better witness back than words, which we, <END>
on like conditions, will have counter-seal'd. <END>
come, enter with us. ladies, you deserve <END>
to have a temple built you: all the swords <END>
in italy, and her confederate arms, <END>
could not have made this peace. <END>
see you yond coign o' the capitol, yond <END>
corner-stone? <END>
why, what of that? <END>
if it be possible for you to displace it with your <END>
little finger, there is some hope the ladies of <END>
rome, especially his mother, may prevail with him. <END>
but i say there is no hope in't: our throats are <END>
sentenced and stay upon execution. <END>
is't possible that so short a time can alter the <END>
condition of a man! <END>
there is differency between a grub and a butterfly; <END>
yet your butterfly was a grub. this marcius is grown <END>
from man to dragon: he has wings; he's more than a <END>
creeping thing. <END>
he loved his mother dearly. <END>
so did he me: and he no more remembers his mother <END>
now than an eight-year-old horse. the tartness <END>
of his face sours ripe grapes: when he walks, he <END>
moves like an engine, and the ground shrinks before <END>
his treading: he is able to pierce a corslet with <END>
his eye; talks like a knell, and his hum is a <END>
battery. he sits in his state, as a thing made for <END>
alexander. what he bids be done is finished with <END>
his bidding. he wants nothing of a god but eternity <END>
and a heaven to throne in. <END>
yes, mercy, if you report him truly. <END>
i paint him in the character. mark what mercy his <END>
mother shall bring from him: there is no more mercy <END>
in him than there is milk in a male tiger; that <END>
shall our poor city find: and all this is long of <END>
you. <END>
the gods be good unto us! <END>
no, in such a case the gods will not be good unto <END>
us. when we banished him, we respected not them; <END>
and, he returning to break our necks, they respect not us. <END>
sir, if you'ld save your life, fly to your house: <END>
the plebeians have got your fellow-tribune <END>
and hale him up and down, all swearing, if <END>
the roman ladies bring not comfort home, <END>
they'll give him death by inches. <END>
what's the news? <END>
good news, good news; the ladies have prevail'd, <END>
the volscians are dislodged, and marcius gone: <END>
a merrier day did never yet greet rome, <END>
no, not the expulsion of the tarquins. <END>
friend, <END>
art thou certain this is true? is it most certain? <END>
as certain as i know the sun is fire: <END>
where have you lurk'd, that you make doubt of it? <END>
ne'er through an arch so hurried the blown tide, <END>
as the recomforted through the gates. why, hark you! <END>
the trumpets, sackbuts, psalteries and fifes, <END>
tabours and cymbals and the shouting romans, <END>
make the sun dance. hark you! <END>
this is good news: <END>
i will go meet the ladies. this volumnia <END>
is worth of consuls, senators, patricians, <END>
a city full; of tribunes, such as you, <END>
a sea and land full. you have pray'd well to-day: <END>
this morning for ten thousand of your throats <END>
i'd not have given a doit. hark, how they joy! <END>
first, the gods bless you for your tidings; next, <END>
accept my thankfulness. <END>
sir, we have all <END>
great cause to give great thanks. <END>
they are near the city? <END>
almost at point to enter. <END>
we will meet them, <END>
and help the joy. <END>
behold our patroness, the life of rome! <END>
call all your tribes together, praise the gods, <END>
and make triumphant fires; strew flowers before them: <END>
unshout the noise that banish'd marcius, <END>
repeal him with the welcome of his mother; <END>
cry 'welcome, ladies, welcome!' <END>
welcome, ladies, welcome! <END>
go tell the lords o' the city i am here: <END>
deliver them this paper: having read it, <END>
bid them repair to the market place; where i, <END>
even in theirs and in the commons' ears, <END>
will vouch the truth of it. him i accuse <END>
the city ports by this hath enter'd and <END>
intends to appear before the people, hoping <END>
to purge herself with words: dispatch. <END>
most welcome! <END>
how is it with our general? <END>
even so <END>
as with a man by his own alms empoison'd, <END>
and with his charity slain. <END>
most noble sir, <END>
if you do hold the same intent wherein <END>
you wish'd us parties, we'll deliver you <END>
of your great danger. <END>
sir, i cannot tell: <END>
we must proceed as we do find the people. <END>
the people will remain uncertain whilst <END>
'twixt you there's difference; but the fall of either <END>
makes the survivor heir of all. <END>
i know it; <END>
and my pretext to strike at him admits <END>
a good construction. i raised him, and i pawn'd <END>
mine honour for his truth: who being so heighten'd, <END>
he water'd his new plants with dews of flattery, <END>
seducing so my friends; and, to this end, <END>
he bow'd his nature, never known before <END>
but to be rough, unswayable and free. <END>
sir, his stoutness <END>
when he did stand for consul, which he lost <END>
by lack of stooping,-- <END>
that i would have spoke of: <END>
being banish'd for't, he came unto my hearth; <END>
presented to my knife his throat: i took him; <END>
made him joint-servant with me; gave him way <END>
in all his own desires; nay, let him choose <END>
out of my files, his projects to accomplish, <END>
my best and freshest men; served his designments <END>
in mine own person; holp to reap the fame <END>
which he did end all his; and took some pride <END>
to do myself this wrong: till, at the last, <END>
i seem'd his follower, not partner, and <END>
he waged me with his countenance, as if <END>
i had been mercenary. <END>
so he did, my lord: <END>
the army marvell'd at it, and, in the last, <END>
when he had carried rome and that we look'd <END>
for no less spoil than glory,-- <END>
there was it: <END>
for which my sinews shall be stretch'd upon him. <END>
at a few drops of women's rheum, which are <END>
as cheap as lies, he sold the blood and labour <END>
of our great action: therefore shall he die, <END>
and i'll renew me in his fall. but, hark! <END>
your native town you enter'd like a post, <END>
and had no welcomes home: but he returns, <END>
splitting the air with noise. <END>
and patient fools, <END>
whose children he hath slain, their base throats tear <END>
with giving him glory. <END>
therefore, at your vantage, <END>
ere he express himself, or move the people <END>
with what he would say, let him feel your sword, <END>
which we will second. when he lies along, <END>
after your way his tale pronounced shall bury <END>
his reasons with his body. <END>
say no more: <END>
here come the lords. <END>
you are most welcome home. <END>
i have not deserved it. <END>
but, worthy lords, have you with heed perused <END>
what i have written to you? <END>
we have. <END>
and grieve to hear't. <END>
what faults he made before the last, i think <END>
might have found easy fines: but there to end <END>
where he was to begin and give away <END>
the benefit of our levies, answering us <END>
with our own charge, making a treaty where <END>
there was a yielding,--this admits no excuse. <END>
he approaches: you shall hear him. <END>
hail, lords! i am return'd your soldier, <END>
no more infected with my country's love <END>
than when i parted hence, but still subsisting <END>
under your great command. you are to know <END>
that prosperously i have attempted and <END>
with bloody passage led your wars even to <END>
the gates of rome. our spoils we have brought home <END>
do more than counterpoise a full third part <END>
the charges of the action. we have made peace <END>
with no less honour to the antiates <END>
than shame to the romans: and we here deliver, <END>
subscribed by the consuls and patricians, <END>
together with the seal o' the senate, what <END>
we have compounded on. <END>
read it not, noble lords; <END>
but tell the traitor, in the high'st degree <END>
he hath abused your powers. <END>
traitor! how now! <END>
ay, traitor, marcius! <END>
marcius! <END>
ay, marcius, caius marcius: dost thou think <END>
i'll grace thee with that robbery, thy stol'n name <END>
coriolanus in corioli? <END>
you lords and heads o' the state, perfidiously <END>
he has betray'd your business, and given up, <END>
for certain drops of salt, your city rome, <END>
i say 'your city,' to his wife and mother; <END>
breaking his oath and resolution like <END>
a twist of rotten silk, never admitting <END>
counsel o' the war, but at his nurse's tears <END>
he whined and roar'd away your victory, <END>
that pages blush'd at him and men of heart <END>
look'd wondering each at other. <END>
hear'st thou, mars? <END>
name not the god, thou boy of tears! <END>
ha! <END>
no more. <END>
measureless liar, thou hast made my heart <END>
too great for what contains it. boy! o slave! <END>
pardon me, lords, 'tis the first time that ever <END>
i was forced to scold. your judgments, my grave lords, <END>
must give this cur the lie: and his own notion-- <END>
who wears my stripes impress'd upon him; that <END>
must bear my beating to his grave--shall join <END>
to thrust the lie unto him. <END>
peace, both, and hear me speak. <END>
cut me to pieces, volsces; men and lads, <END>
stain all your edges on me. boy! false hound! <END>
if you have writ your annals true, 'tis there, <END>
that, like an eagle in a dove-cote, i <END>
flutter'd your volscians in corioli: <END>
alone i did it. boy! <END>
why, noble lords, <END>
will you be put in mind of his blind fortune, <END>
which was your shame, by this unholy braggart, <END>
'fore your own eyes and ears? <END>
let him die for't. <END>
'tear him to pieces.' 'do it presently.' 'he kill'd <END>
my son.' 'my daughter.' 'he killed my cousin <END>
marcus.' 'he killed my father.' <END>
peace, ho! no outrage: peace! <END>
the man is noble and his fame folds-in <END>
this orb o' the earth. his last offences to us <END>
shall have judicious hearing. stand, aufidius, <END>
and trouble not the peace. <END>
o that i had him, <END>
with six aufidiuses, or more, his tribe, <END>
to use my lawful sword! <END>
insolent villain! <END>
kill, kill, kill, kill, kill him! <END>
hold, hold, hold, hold! <END>
my noble masters, hear me speak. <END>
o tullus,-- <END>
thou hast done a deed whereat valour will weep. <END>
tread not upon him. masters all, be quiet; <END>
put up your swords. <END>
my lords, when you shall know--as in this rage, <END>
provoked by him, you cannot--the great danger <END>
which this man's life did owe you, you'll rejoice <END>
that he is thus cut off. please it your honours <END>
to call me to your senate, i'll deliver <END>
myself your loyal servant, or endure <END>
your heaviest censure. <END>
bear from hence his body; <END>
and mourn you for him: let him be regarded <END>
as the most noble corse that ever herald <END>
did follow to his urn. <END>
his own impatience <END>
takes from aufidius a great part of blame. <END>
let's make the best of it. <END>
my rage is gone; <END>
and i am struck with sorrow. take him up. <END>
help, three o' the chiefest soldiers; i'll be one. <END>
beat thou the drum, that it speak mournfully: <END>
trail your steel pikes. though in this city he <END>
hath widow'd and unchilded many a one, <END>
which to this hour bewail the injury, <END>
yet he shall have a noble memory. assist. <END>
now is the winter of our discontent <END>
made glorious summer by this sun of york; <END>
and all the clouds that lour'd upon our house <END>
in the deep bosom of the ocean buried. <END>
now are our brows bound with victorious wreaths; <END>
our bruised arms hung up for monuments; <END>
our stern alarums changed to merry meetings, <END>
our dreadful marches to delightful measures. <END>
grim-visaged war hath smooth'd his wrinkled front; <END>
and now, instead of mounting barded steeds <END>
to fright the souls of fearful adversaries, <END>
he capers nimbly in a lady's chamber <END>
to the lascivious pleasing of a lute. <END>
but i, that am not shaped for sportive tricks, <END>
nor made to court an amorous looking-glass; <END>
i, that am rudely stamp'd, and want love's majesty <END>
to strut before a wanton ambling nymph; <END>
i, that am curtail'd of this fair proportion, <END>
cheated of feature by dissembling nature, <END>
deformed, unfinish'd, sent before my time <END>
into this breathing world, scarce half made up, <END>
and that so lamely and unfashionable <END>
that dogs bark at me as i halt by them; <END>
why, i, in this weak piping time of peace, <END>
have no delight to pass away the time, <END>
unless to spy my shadow in the sun <END>
and descant on mine own deformity: <END>
and therefore, since i cannot prove a lover, <END>
to entertain these fair well-spoken days, <END>
i am determined to prove a villain <END>
and hate the idle pleasures of these days. <END>
plots have i laid, inductions dangerous, <END>
by drunken prophecies, libels and dreams, <END>
to set my brother clarence and the king <END>
in deadly hate the one against the other: <END>
and if king edward be as true and just <END>
as i am subtle, false and treacherous, <END>
this day should clarence closely be mew'd up, <END>
about a prophecy, which says that 'g' <END>
of edward's heirs the murderer shall be. <END>
dive, thoughts, down to my soul: here <END>
clarence comes. <END>
brother, good day; what means this armed guard <END>
that waits upon your grace? <END>
his majesty <END>
tendering my person's safety, hath appointed <END>
this conduct to convey me to the tower. <END>
upon what cause? <END>
because my name is george. <END>
alack, my lord, that fault is none of yours; <END>
he should, for that, commit your godfathers: <END>
o, belike his majesty hath some intent <END>
that you shall be new-christen'd in the tower. <END>
but what's the matter, clarence?  may i know? <END>
yea, richard, when i know; for i protest <END>
as yet i do not: but, as i can learn, <END>
he hearkens after prophecies and dreams; <END>
and from the cross-row plucks the letter g. <END>
and says a wizard told him that by g <END>
his issue disinherited should be; <END>
and, for my name of george begins with g, <END>
it follows in his thought that i am he. <END>
these, as i learn, and such like toys as these <END>
have moved his highness to commit me now. <END>
why, this it is, when men are ruled by women: <END>
'tis not the king that sends you to the tower: <END>
my lady grey his wife, clarence, 'tis she <END>
that tempers him to this extremity. <END>
was it not she and that good man of worship, <END>
anthony woodville, her brother there, <END>
that made him send lord hastings to the tower, <END>
from whence this present day he is deliver'd? <END>
we are not safe, clarence; we are not safe. <END>
by heaven, i think there's no man is secure <END>
but the queen's kindred and night-walking heralds <END>
that trudge betwixt the king and mistress shore. <END>
heard ye not what an humble suppliant <END>
lord hastings was to her for his delivery? <END>
humbly complaining to her deity <END>
got my lord chamberlain his liberty. <END>
i'll tell you what; i think it is our way, <END>
if we will keep in favour with the king, <END>
to be her men and wear her livery: <END>
the jealous o'erworn widow and herself, <END>
since that our brother dubb'd them gentlewomen. <END>
are mighty gossips in this monarchy. <END>
i beseech your graces both to pardon me; <END>
his majesty hath straitly given in charge <END>
that no man shall have private conference, <END>
of what degree soever, with his brother. <END>
even so; an't please your worship, brakenbury, <END>
you may partake of any thing we say: <END>
we speak no treason, man: we say the king <END>
is wise and virtuous, and his noble queen <END>
well struck in years, fair, and not jealous; <END>
we say that shore's wife hath a pretty foot, <END>
a cherry lip, a bonny eye, a passing pleasing tongue; <END>
and that the queen's kindred are made gentle-folks: <END>
how say you sir? can you deny all this? <END>
with this, my lord, myself have nought to do. <END>
naught to do with mistress shore! i tell thee, fellow, <END>
he that doth naught with her, excepting one, <END>
were best he do it secretly, alone. <END>
what one, my lord? <END>
her husband, knave: wouldst thou betray me? <END>
i beseech your grace to pardon me, and withal <END>
forbear your conference with the noble duke. <END>
we know thy charge, brakenbury, and will obey. <END>
we are the queen's abjects, and must obey. <END>
brother, farewell: i will unto the king; <END>
and whatsoever you will employ me in, <END>
were it to call king edward's widow sister, <END>
i will perform it to enfranchise you. <END>
meantime, this deep disgrace in brotherhood <END>
touches me deeper than you can imagine. <END>
i know it pleaseth neither of us well. <END>
well, your imprisonment shall not be long; <END>
meantime, have patience. <END>
i must perforce. farewell. <END>
go, tread the path that thou shalt ne'er return. <END>
simple, plain clarence! i do love thee so, <END>
that i will shortly send thy soul to heaven, <END>
if heaven will take the present at our hands. <END>
but who comes here? the new-deliver'd hastings? <END>
good time of day unto my gracious lord! <END>
as much unto my good lord chamberlain! <END>
well are you welcome to the open air. <END>
how hath your lordship brook'd imprisonment? <END>
with patience, noble lord, as prisoners must: <END>
but i shall live, my lord, to give them thanks <END>
that were the cause of my imprisonment. <END>
no doubt, no doubt; and so shall clarence too; <END>
for they that were your enemies are his, <END>
and have prevail'd as much on him as you. <END>
more pity that the eagle should be mew'd, <END>
while kites and buzzards prey at liberty. <END>
what news abroad? <END>
no news so bad abroad as this at home; <END>
the king is sickly, weak and melancholy, <END>
and his physicians fear him mightily. <END>
now, by saint paul, this news is bad indeed. <END>
o, he hath kept an evil diet long, <END>
and overmuch consumed his royal person: <END>
'tis very grievous to be thought upon. <END>
what, is he in his bed? <END>
he is. <END>
go you before, and i will follow you. <END>
he cannot live, i hope; and must not die <END>
till george be pack'd with post-horse up to heaven. <END>
i'll in, to urge his hatred more to clarence, <END>
with lies well steel'd with weighty arguments; <END>
and, if i fall not in my deep intent, <END>
clarence hath not another day to live: <END>
which done, god take king edward to his mercy, <END>
and leave the world for me to bustle in! <END>
for then i'll marry warwick's youngest daughter. <END>
what though i kill'd her husband and her father? <END>
the readiest way to make the wench amends <END>
is to become her husband and her father: <END>
the which will i; not all so much for love <END>
as for another secret close intent, <END>
by marrying her which i must reach unto. <END>
but yet i run before my horse to market: <END>
clarence still breathes; edward still lives and reigns: <END>
when they are gone, then must i count my gains. <END>
set down, set down your honourable load, <END>
if honour may be shrouded in a hearse, <END>
whilst i awhile obsequiously lament <END>
the untimely fall of virtuous lancaster. <END>
poor key-cold figure of a holy king! <END>
pale ashes of the house of lancaster! <END>
thou bloodless remnant of that royal blood! <END>
be it lawful that i invocate thy ghost, <END>
to hear the lamentations of poor anne, <END>
wife to thy edward, to thy slaughter'd son, <END>
stabb'd by the selfsame hand that made these wounds! <END>
lo, in these windows that let forth thy life, <END>
i pour the helpless balm of my poor eyes. <END>
cursed be the hand that made these fatal holes! <END>
cursed be the heart that had the heart to do it! <END>
cursed the blood that let this blood from hence! <END>
more direful hap betide that hated wretch, <END>
that makes us wretched by the death of thee, <END>
than i can wish to adders, spiders, toads, <END>
or any creeping venom'd thing that lives! <END>
if ever he have child, abortive be it, <END>
prodigious, and untimely brought to light, <END>
whose ugly and unnatural aspect <END>
may fright the hopeful mother at the view; <END>
and that be heir to his unhappiness! <END>
if ever he have wife, let her he made <END>
a miserable by the death of him <END>
as i am made by my poor lord and thee! <END>
come, now towards chertsey with your holy load, <END>
taken from paul's to be interred there; <END>
and still, as you are weary of the weight, <END>
rest you, whiles i lament king henry's corse. <END>
stay, you that bear the corse, and set it down. <END>
what black magician conjures up this fiend, <END>
to stop devoted charitable deeds? <END>
villains, set down the corse; or, by saint paul, <END>
i'll make a corse of him that disobeys. <END>
my lord, stand back, and let the coffin pass. <END>
unmanner'd dog! stand thou, when i command: <END>
advance thy halbert higher than my breast, <END>
or, by saint paul, i'll strike thee to my foot, <END>
and spurn upon thee, beggar, for thy boldness. <END>
what, do you tremble? are you all afraid? <END>
alas, i blame you not; for you are mortal, <END>
and mortal eyes cannot endure the devil. <END>
avaunt, thou dreadful minister of hell! <END>
thou hadst but power over his mortal body, <END>
his soul thou canst not have; therefore be gone. <END>
sweet saint, for charity, be not so curst. <END>
foul devil, for god's sake, hence, and trouble us not; <END>
for thou hast made the happy earth thy hell, <END>
fill'd it with cursing cries and deep exclaims. <END>
if thou delight to view thy heinous deeds, <END>
behold this pattern of thy butcheries. <END>
o, gentlemen, see, see! dead henry's wounds <END>
open their congeal'd mouths and bleed afresh! <END>
blush, blush, thou lump of foul deformity; <END>
for 'tis thy presence that exhales this blood <END>
from cold and empty veins, where no blood dwells; <END>
thy deed, inhuman and unnatural, <END>
provokes this deluge most unnatural. <END>
o god, which this blood madest, revenge his death! <END>
o earth, which this blood drink'st revenge his death! <END>
either heaven with lightning strike the <END>
murderer dead, <END>
or earth, gape open wide and eat him quick, <END>
as thou dost swallow up this good king's blood <END>
which his hell-govern'd arm hath butchered! <END>
lady, you know no rules of charity, <END>
which renders good for bad, blessings for curses. <END>
villain, thou know'st no law of god nor man: <END>
no beast so fierce but knows some touch of pity. <END>
but i know none, and therefore am no beast. <END>
o wonderful, when devils tell the truth! <END>
more wonderful, when angels are so angry. <END>
vouchsafe, divine perfection of a woman, <END>
of these supposed-evils, to give me leave, <END>
by circumstance, but to acquit myself. <END>
vouchsafe, defused infection of a man, <END>
for these known evils, but to give me leave, <END>
by circumstance, to curse thy cursed self. <END>
fairer than tongue can name thee, let me have <END>
some patient leisure to excuse myself. <END>
fouler than heart can think thee, thou canst make <END>
no excuse current, but to hang thyself. <END>
by such despair, i should accuse myself. <END>
and, by despairing, shouldst thou stand excused; <END>
for doing worthy vengeance on thyself, <END>
which didst unworthy slaughter upon others. <END>
say that i slew them not? <END>
why, then they are not dead: <END>
but dead they are, and devilish slave, by thee. <END>
i did not kill your husband. <END>
why, then he is alive. <END>
nay, he is dead; and slain by edward's hand. <END>
in thy foul throat thou liest: queen margaret saw <END>
thy murderous falchion smoking in his blood; <END>
the which thou once didst bend against her breast, <END>
but that thy brothers beat aside the point. <END>
i was provoked by her slanderous tongue, <END>
which laid their guilt upon my guiltless shoulders. <END>
thou wast provoked by thy bloody mind. <END>
which never dreamt on aught but butcheries: <END>
didst thou not kill this king? <END>
i grant ye. <END>
dost grant me, hedgehog? then, god grant me too <END>
thou mayst be damned for that wicked deed! <END>
o, he was gentle, mild, and virtuous! <END>
the fitter for the king of heaven, that hath him. <END>
he is in heaven, where thou shalt never come. <END>
let him thank me, that holp to send him thither; <END>
for he was fitter for that place than earth. <END>
and thou unfit for any place but hell. <END>
yes, one place else, if you will hear me name it. <END>
some dungeon. <END>
your bed-chamber. <END>
i'll rest betide the chamber where thou liest! <END>
so will it, madam till i lie with you. <END>
i hope so. <END>
i know so. but, gentle lady anne, <END>
to leave this keen encounter of our wits, <END>
and fall somewhat into a slower method, <END>
is not the causer of the timeless deaths <END>
of these plantagenets, henry and edward, <END>
as blameful as the executioner? <END>
thou art the cause, and most accursed effect. <END>
your beauty was the cause of that effect; <END>
your beauty: which did haunt me in my sleep <END>
to undertake the death of all the world, <END>
so i might live one hour in your sweet bosom. <END>
if i thought that, i tell thee, homicide, <END>
these nails should rend that beauty from my cheeks. <END>
these eyes could never endure sweet beauty's wreck; <END>
you should not blemish it, if i stood by: <END>
as all the world is cheered by the sun, <END>
so i by that; it is my day, my life. <END>
black night o'ershade thy day, and death thy life! <END>
curse not thyself, fair creature thou art both. <END>
i would i were, to be revenged on thee. <END>
it is a quarrel most unnatural, <END>
to be revenged on him that loveth you. <END>
it is a quarrel just and reasonable, <END>
to be revenged on him that slew my husband. <END>
he that bereft thee, lady, of thy husband, <END>
did it to help thee to a better husband. <END>
his better doth not breathe upon the earth. <END>
he lives that loves thee better than he could. <END>
name him. <END>
plantagenet. <END>
why, that was he. <END>
the selfsame name, but one of better nature. <END>
where is he? <END>
here. <END>
why dost thou spit at me? <END>
would it were mortal poison, for thy sake! <END>
never came poison from so sweet a place. <END>
never hung poison on a fouler toad. <END>
out of my sight! thou dost infect my eyes. <END>
thine eyes, sweet lady, have infected mine. <END>
would they were basilisks, to strike thee dead! <END>
i would they were, that i might die at once; <END>
for now they kill me with a living death. <END>
those eyes of thine from mine have drawn salt tears, <END>
shamed their aspect with store of childish drops: <END>
these eyes that never shed remorseful tear, <END>
no, when my father york and edward wept, <END>
to hear the piteous moan that rutland made <END>
when black-faced clifford shook his sword at him; <END>
nor when thy warlike father, like a child, <END>
told the sad story of my father's death, <END>
and twenty times made pause to sob and weep, <END>
that all the standers-by had wet their cheeks <END>
like trees bedash'd with rain: in that sad time <END>
my manly eyes did scorn an humble tear; <END>
and what these sorrows could not thence exhale, <END>
thy beauty hath, and made them blind with weeping. <END>
i never sued to friend nor enemy; <END>
my tongue could never learn sweet smoothing word; <END>
but now thy beauty is proposed my fee, <END>
my proud heart sues, and prompts my tongue to speak. <END>
teach not thy lips such scorn, for they were made <END>
for kissing, lady, not for such contempt. <END>
if thy revengeful heart cannot forgive, <END>
lo, here i lend thee this sharp-pointed sword; <END>
which if thou please to hide in this true bosom. <END>
and let the soul forth that adoreth thee, <END>
i lay it naked to the deadly stroke, <END>
and humbly beg the death upon my knee. <END>
nay, do not pause; for i did kill king henry, <END>
but 'twas thy beauty that provoked me. <END>
nay, now dispatch; 'twas i that stabb'd young edward, <END>
but 'twas thy heavenly face that set me on. <END>
take up the sword again, or take up me. <END>
arise, dissembler: though i wish thy death, <END>
i will not be the executioner. <END>
then bid me kill myself, and i will do it. <END>
i have already. <END>
tush, that was in thy rage: <END>
speak it again, and, even with the word, <END>
that hand, which, for thy love, did kill thy love, <END>
shall, for thy love, kill a far truer love; <END>
to both their deaths thou shalt be accessary. <END>
i would i knew thy heart. <END>
'tis figured in my tongue. <END>
i fear me both are false. <END>
then never man was true. <END>
well, well, put up your sword. <END>
say, then, my peace is made. <END>
that shall you know hereafter. <END>
but shall i live in hope? <END>
all men, i hope, live so. <END>
vouchsafe to wear this ring. <END>
to take is not to give. <END>
look, how this ring encompasseth finger. <END>
even so thy breast encloseth my poor heart; <END>
wear both of them, for both of them are thine. <END>
and if thy poor devoted suppliant may <END>
but beg one favour at thy gracious hand, <END>
thou dost confirm his happiness for ever. <END>
what is it? <END>
that it would please thee leave these sad designs <END>
to him that hath more cause to be a mourner, <END>
and presently repair to crosby place; <END>
where, after i have solemnly interr'd <END>
at chertsey monastery this noble king, <END>
and wet his grave with my repentant tears, <END>
i will with all expedient duty see you: <END>
for divers unknown reasons. i beseech you, <END>
grant me this boon. <END>
with all my heart; and much it joys me too, <END>
to see you are become so penitent. <END>
tressel and berkeley, go along with me. <END>
bid me farewell. <END>
'tis more than you deserve; <END>
but since you teach me how to flatter you, <END>
imagine i have said farewell already. <END>
sirs, take up the corse. <END>
towards chertsey, noble lord? <END>
no, to white-friars; there attend my coining. <END>
was ever woman in this humour woo'd? <END>
was ever woman in this humour won? <END>
i'll have her; but i will not keep her long. <END>
what! i, that kill'd her husband and his father, <END>
to take her in her heart's extremest hate, <END>
with curses in her mouth, tears in her eyes, <END>
the bleeding witness of her hatred by; <END>
having god, her conscience, and these bars <END>
against me, <END>
and i nothing to back my suit at all, <END>
but the plain devil and dissembling looks, <END>
and yet to win her, all the world to nothing! <END>
ha! <END>
hath she forgot already that brave prince, <END>
edward, her lord, whom i, some three months since, <END>
stabb'd in my angry mood at tewksbury? <END>
a sweeter and a lovelier gentleman, <END>
framed in the prodigality of nature, <END>
young, valiant, wise, and, no doubt, right royal, <END>
the spacious world cannot again afford <END>
and will she yet debase her eyes on me, <END>
that cropp'd the golden prime of this sweet prince, <END>
and made her widow to a woful bed? <END>
on me, whose all not equals edward's moiety? <END>
on me, that halt and am unshapen thus? <END>
my dukedom to a beggarly denier, <END>
i do mistake my person all this while: <END>
upon my life, she finds, although i cannot, <END>
myself to be a marvellous proper man. <END>
i'll be at charges for a looking-glass, <END>
and entertain some score or two of tailors, <END>
to study fashions to adorn my body: <END>
since i am crept in favour with myself, <END>
will maintain it with some little cost. <END>
but first i'll turn yon fellow in his grave; <END>
and then return lamenting to my love. <END>
shine out, fair sun, till i have bought a glass, <END>
that i may see my shadow as i pass. <END>
have patience, madam: there's no doubt his majesty <END>
will soon recover his accustom'd health. <END>
in that you brook it in, it makes him worse: <END>
therefore, for god's sake, entertain good comfort, <END>
and cheer his grace with quick and merry words. <END>
if he were dead, what would betide of me? <END>
no other harm but loss of such a lord. <END>
the loss of such a lord includes all harm. <END>
the heavens have bless'd you with a goodly son, <END>
to be your comforter when he is gone. <END>
oh, he is young and his minority <END>
is put unto the trust of richard gloucester, <END>
a man that loves not me, nor none of you. <END>
is it concluded that he shall be protector? <END>
it is determined, not concluded yet: <END>
but so it must be, if the king miscarry. <END>
here come the lords of buckingham and derby. <END>
good time of day unto your royal grace! <END>
god make your majesty joyful as you have been! <END>
the countess richmond, good my lord of derby. <END>
to your good prayers will scarcely say amen. <END>
yet, derby, notwithstanding she's your wife, <END>
and loves not me, be you, good lord, assured <END>
i hate not you for her proud arrogance. <END>
i do beseech you, either not believe <END>
the envious slanders of her false accusers; <END>
or, if she be accused in true report, <END>
bear with her weakness, which, i think proceeds <END>
from wayward sickness, and no grounded malice. <END>
saw you the king to-day, my lord of derby? <END>
but now the duke of buckingham and i <END>
are come from visiting his majesty. <END>
what likelihood of his amendment, lords? <END>
madam, good hope; his grace speaks cheerfully. <END>
god grant him health! did you confer with him? <END>
madam, we did: he desires to make atonement <END>
betwixt the duke of gloucester and your brothers, <END>
and betwixt them and my lord chamberlain; <END>
and sent to warn them to his royal presence. <END>
would all were well! but that will never be <END>
i fear our happiness is at the highest. <END>
they do me wrong, and i will not endure it: <END>
who are they that complain unto the king, <END>
that i, forsooth, am stern, and love them not? <END>
by holy paul, they love his grace but lightly <END>
that fill his ears with such dissentious rumours. <END>
because i cannot flatter and speak fair, <END>
smile in men's faces, smooth, deceive and cog, <END>
duck with french nods and apish courtesy, <END>
i must be held a rancorous enemy. <END>
cannot a plain man live and think no harm, <END>
but thus his simple truth must be abused <END>
by silken, sly, insinuating jacks? <END>
to whom in all this presence speaks your grace? <END>
to thee, that hast nor honesty nor grace. <END>
when have i injured thee? when done thee wrong? <END>
or thee? or thee? or any of your faction? <END>
a plague upon you all! his royal person,-- <END>
whom god preserve better than you would wish!-- <END>
cannot be quiet scarce a breathing-while, <END>
but you must trouble him with lewd complaints. <END>
brother of gloucester, you mistake the matter. <END>
the king, of his own royal disposition, <END>
and not provoked by any suitor else; <END>
aiming, belike, at your interior hatred, <END>
which in your outward actions shows itself <END>
against my kindred, brothers, and myself, <END>
makes him to send; that thereby he may gather <END>
the ground of your ill-will, and so remove it. <END>
i cannot tell: the world is grown so bad, <END>
that wrens make prey where eagles dare not perch: <END>
since every jack became a gentleman <END>
there's many a gentle person made a jack. <END>
come, come, we know your meaning, brother <END>
gloucester; <END>
you envy my advancement and my friends': <END>
god grant we never may have need of you! <END>
meantime, god grants that we have need of you: <END>
your brother is imprison'd by your means, <END>
myself disgraced, and the nobility <END>
held in contempt; whilst many fair promotions <END>
are daily given to ennoble those <END>
that scarce, some two days since, were worth a noble. <END>
by him that raised me to this careful height <END>
from that contented hap which i enjoy'd, <END>
i never did incense his majesty <END>
against the duke of clarence, but have been <END>
an earnest advocate to plead for him. <END>
my lord, you do me shameful injury, <END>
falsely to draw me in these vile suspects. <END>
you may deny that you were not the cause <END>
of my lord hastings' late imprisonment. <END>
she may, my lord, for-- <END>
she may, lord rivers! why, who knows not so? <END>
she may do more, sir, than denying that: <END>
she may help you to many fair preferments, <END>
and then deny her aiding hand therein, <END>
and lay those honours on your high deserts. <END>
what may she not? she may, yea, marry, may she-- <END>
what, marry, may she? <END>
what, marry, may she! marry with a king, <END>
a bachelor, a handsome stripling too: <END>
i wis your grandam had a worser match. <END>
my lord of gloucester, i have too long borne <END>
your blunt upbraidings and your bitter scoffs: <END>
by heaven, i will acquaint his majesty <END>
with those gross taunts i often have endured. <END>
i had rather be a country servant-maid <END>
than a great queen, with this condition, <END>
to be thus taunted, scorn'd, and baited at: <END>
small joy have i in being england's queen. <END>
and lessen'd be that small, god, i beseech thee! <END>
thy honour, state and seat is due to me. <END>
what! threat you me with telling of the king? <END>
tell him, and spare not: look, what i have said <END>
i will avouch in presence of the king: <END>
i dare adventure to be sent to the tower. <END>
'tis time to speak; my pains are quite forgot. <END>
out, devil! i remember them too well: <END>
thou slewest my husband henry in the tower, <END>
and edward, my poor son, at tewksbury. <END>
ere you were queen, yea, or your husband king, <END>
i was a pack-horse in his great affairs; <END>
a weeder-out of his proud adversaries, <END>
a liberal rewarder of his friends: <END>
to royalize his blood i spilt mine own. <END>
yea, and much better blood than his or thine. <END>
in all which time you and your husband grey <END>
were factious for the house of lancaster; <END>
and, rivers, so were you. was not your husband <END>
in margaret's battle at saint alban's slain? <END>
let me put in your minds, if you forget, <END>
what you have been ere now, and what you are; <END>
withal, what i have been, and what i am. <END>
a murderous villain, and so still thou art. <END>
poor clarence did forsake his father, warwick; <END>
yea, and forswore himself,--which jesu pardon!-- <END>
which god revenge! <END>
to fight on edward's party for the crown; <END>
and for his meed, poor lord, he is mew'd up. <END>
i would to god my heart were flint, like edward's; <END>
or edward's soft and pitiful, like mine <END>
i am too childish-foolish for this world. <END>
hie thee to hell for shame, and leave the world, <END>
thou cacodemon! there thy kingdom is. <END>
my lord of gloucester, in those busy days <END>
which here you urge to prove us enemies, <END>
we follow'd then our lord, our lawful king: <END>
so should we you, if you should be our king. <END>
if i should be! i had rather be a pedlar: <END>
far be it from my heart, the thought of it! <END>
as little joy, my lord, as you suppose <END>
you should enjoy, were you this country's king, <END>
as little joy may you suppose in me. <END>
that i enjoy, being the queen thereof. <END>
a little joy enjoys the queen thereof; <END>
for i am she, and altogether joyless. <END>
i can no longer hold me patient. <END>
hear me, you wrangling pirates, that fall out <END>
in sharing that which you have pill'd from me! <END>
which of you trembles not that looks on me? <END>
if not, that, i being queen, you bow like subjects, <END>
yet that, by you deposed, you quake like rebels? <END>
o gentle villain, do not turn away! <END>
foul wrinkled witch, what makest thou in my sight? <END>
but repetition of what thou hast marr'd; <END>
that will i make before i let thee go. <END>
wert thou not banished on pain of death? <END>
i was; but i do find more pain in banishment <END>
than death can yield me here by my abode. <END>
a husband and a son thou owest to me; <END>
and thou a kingdom; all of you allegiance: <END>
the sorrow that i have, by right is yours, <END>
and all the pleasures you usurp are mine. <END>
the curse my noble father laid on thee, <END>
when thou didst crown his warlike brows with paper <END>
and with thy scorns drew'st rivers from his eyes, <END>
and then, to dry them, gavest the duke a clout <END>
steep'd in the faultless blood of pretty rutland-- <END>
his curses, then from bitterness of soul <END>
denounced against thee, are all fall'n upon thee; <END>
and god, not we, hath plagued thy bloody deed. <END>
so just is god, to right the innocent. <END>
o, 'twas the foulest deed to slay that babe, <END>
and the most merciless that e'er was heard of! <END>
tyrants themselves wept when it was reported. <END>
no man but prophesied revenge for it. <END>
northumberland, then present, wept to see it. <END>
what were you snarling all before i came, <END>
ready to catch each other by the throat, <END>
and turn you all your hatred now on me? <END>
did york's dread curse prevail so much with heaven? <END>
that henry's death, my lovely edward's death, <END>
their kingdom's loss, my woful banishment, <END>
could all but answer for that peevish brat? <END>
can curses pierce the clouds and enter heaven? <END>
why, then, give way, dull clouds, to my quick curses! <END>
if not by war, by surfeit die your king, <END>
as ours by murder, to make him a king! <END>
edward thy son, which now is prince of wales, <END>
for edward my son, which was prince of wales, <END>
die in his youth by like untimely violence! <END>
thyself a queen, for me that was a queen, <END>
outlive thy glory, like my wretched self! <END>
long mayst thou live to wail thy children's loss; <END>
and see another, as i see thee now, <END>
deck'd in thy rights, as thou art stall'd in mine! <END>
long die thy happy days before thy death; <END>
and, after many lengthen'd hours of grief, <END>
die neither mother, wife, nor england's queen! <END>
rivers and dorset, you were standers by, <END>
and so wast thou, lord hastings, when my son <END>
was stabb'd with bloody daggers: god, i pray him, <END>
that none of you may live your natural age, <END>
but by some unlook'd accident cut off! <END>
have done thy charm, thou hateful wither'd hag! <END>
and leave out thee? stay, dog, for thou shalt hear me. <END>
if heaven have any grievous plague in store <END>
exceeding those that i can wish upon thee, <END>
o, let them keep it till thy sins be ripe, <END>
and then hurl down their indignation <END>
on thee, the troubler of the poor world's peace! <END>
the worm of conscience still begnaw thy soul! <END>
thy friends suspect for traitors while thou livest, <END>
and take deep traitors for thy dearest friends! <END>
no sleep close up that deadly eye of thine, <END>
unless it be whilst some tormenting dream <END>
affrights thee with a hell of ugly devils! <END>
thou elvish-mark'd, abortive, rooting hog! <END>
thou that wast seal'd in thy nativity <END>
the slave of nature and the son of hell! <END>
thou slander of thy mother's heavy womb! <END>
thou loathed issue of thy father's loins! <END>
thou rag of honour! thou detested-- <END>
margaret. <END>
richard! <END>
ha! <END>
i call thee not. <END>
i cry thee mercy then, for i had thought <END>
that thou hadst call'd me all these bitter names. <END>
why, so i did; but look'd for no reply. <END>
o, let me make the period to my curse! <END>
'tis done by me, and ends in 'margaret.' <END>
thus have you breathed your curse against yourself. <END>
poor painted queen, vain flourish of my fortune! <END>
why strew'st thou sugar on that bottled spider, <END>
whose deadly web ensnareth thee about? <END>
fool, fool! thou whet'st a knife to kill thyself. <END>
the time will come when thou shalt wish for me <END>
to help thee curse that poisonous bunchback'd toad. <END>
false-boding woman, end thy frantic curse, <END>
lest to thy harm thou move our patience. <END>
foul shame upon you! you have all moved mine. <END>
were you well served, you would be taught your duty. <END>
to serve me well, you all should do me duty, <END>
teach me to be your queen, and you my subjects: <END>
o, serve me well, and teach yourselves that duty! <END>
dispute not with her; she is lunatic. <END>
peace, master marquess, you are malapert: <END>
your fire-new stamp of honour is scarce current. <END>
o, that your young nobility could judge <END>
what 'twere to lose it, and be miserable! <END>
they that stand high have many blasts to shake them; <END>
and if they fall, they dash themselves to pieces. <END>
good counsel, marry: learn it, learn it, marquess. <END>
it toucheth you, my lord, as much as me. <END>
yea, and much more: but i was born so high, <END>
our aery buildeth in the cedar's top, <END>
and dallies with the wind and scorns the sun. <END>
and turns the sun to shade; alas! alas! <END>
witness my son, now in the shade of death; <END>
whose bright out-shining beams thy cloudy wrath <END>
hath in eternal darkness folded up. <END>
your aery buildeth in our aery's nest. <END>
o god, that seest it, do not suffer it! <END>
as it was won with blood, lost be it so! <END>
have done! for shame, if not for charity. <END>
urge neither charity nor shame to me: <END>
uncharitably with me have you dealt, <END>
and shamefully by you my hopes are butcher'd. <END>
my charity is outrage, life my shame <END>
and in that shame still live my sorrow's rage. <END>
have done, have done. <END>
o princely buckingham i'll kiss thy hand, <END>
in sign of league and amity with thee: <END>
now fair befal thee and thy noble house! <END>
thy garments are not spotted with our blood, <END>
nor thou within the compass of my curse. <END>
nor no one here; for curses never pass <END>
the lips of those that breathe them in the air. <END>
i'll not believe but they ascend the sky, <END>
and there awake god's gentle-sleeping peace. <END>
o buckingham, take heed of yonder dog! <END>
look, when he fawns, he bites; and when he bites, <END>
his venom tooth will rankle to the death: <END>
have not to do with him, beware of him; <END>
sin, death, and hell have set their marks on him, <END>
and all their ministers attend on him. <END>
what doth she say, my lord of buckingham? <END>
nothing that i respect, my gracious lord. <END>
what, dost thou scorn me for my gentle counsel? <END>
and soothe the devil that i warn thee from? <END>
o, but remember this another day, <END>
when he shall split thy very heart with sorrow, <END>
and say poor margaret was a prophetess! <END>
live each of you the subjects to his hate, <END>
and he to yours, and all of you to god's! <END>
my hair doth stand on end to hear her curses. <END>
and so doth mine: i muse why she's at liberty. <END>
i cannot blame her: by god's holy mother, <END>
she hath had too much wrong; and i repent <END>
my part thereof that i have done to her. <END>
i never did her any, to my knowledge. <END>
but you have all the vantage of her wrong. <END>
i was too hot to do somebody good, <END>
that is too cold in thinking of it now. <END>
marry, as for clarence, he is well repaid, <END>
he is frank'd up to fatting for his pains <END>
god pardon them that are the cause of it! <END>
a virtuous and a christian-like conclusion, <END>
to pray for them that have done scathe to us. <END>
so do i ever: <END>
being well-advised. <END>
for had i cursed now, i had cursed myself. <END>
madam, his majesty doth call for you, <END>
and for your grace; and you, my noble lords. <END>
catesby, we come. lords, will you go with us? <END>
madam, we will attend your grace. <END>
i do the wrong, and first begin to brawl. <END>
the secret mischiefs that i set abroach <END>
i lay unto the grievous charge of others. <END>
clarence, whom i, indeed, have laid in darkness, <END>
i do beweep to many simple gulls <END>
namely, to hastings, derby, buckingham; <END>
and say it is the queen and her allies <END>
that stir the king against the duke my brother. <END>
now, they believe it; and withal whet me <END>
to be revenged on rivers, vaughan, grey: <END>
but then i sigh; and, with a piece of scripture, <END>
tell them that god bids us do good for evil: <END>
and thus i clothe my naked villany <END>
with old odd ends stolen out of holy writ; <END>
and seem a saint, when most i play the devil. <END>
but, soft! here come my executioners. <END>
how now, my hardy, stout resolved mates! <END>
are you now going to dispatch this deed? <END>
we are, my lord; and come to have the warrant <END>
that we may be admitted where he is. <END>
well thought upon; i have it here about me. <END>
when you have done, repair to crosby place. <END>
but, sirs, be sudden in the execution, <END>
withal obdurate, do not hear him plead; <END>
for clarence is well-spoken, and perhaps <END>
may move your hearts to pity if you mark him. <END>
tush! <END>
fear not, my lord, we will not stand to prate; <END>
talkers are no good doers: be assured <END>
we come to use our hands and not our tongues. <END>
your eyes drop millstones, when fools' eyes drop tears: <END>
i like you, lads; about your business straight; <END>
go, go, dispatch. <END>
we will, my noble lord. <END>
why looks your grace so heavily today? <END>
o, i have pass'd a miserable night, <END>
so full of ugly sights, of ghastly dreams, <END>
that, as i am a christian faithful man, <END>
i would not spend another such a night, <END>
though 'twere to buy a world of happy days, <END>
so full of dismal terror was the time! <END>
what was your dream? i long to hear you tell it. <END>
methoughts that i had broken from the tower, <END>
and was embark'd to cross to burgundy; <END>
and, in my company, my brother gloucester; <END>
who from my cabin tempted me to walk <END>
upon the hatches: thence we looked toward england, <END>
and cited up a thousand fearful times, <END>
during the wars of york and lancaster <END>
that had befall'n us. as we paced along <END>
upon the giddy footing of the hatches, <END>
methought that gloucester stumbled; and, in falling, <END>
struck me, that thought to stay him, overboard, <END>
into the tumbling billows of the main. <END>
lord, lord! methought, what pain it was to drown! <END>
what dreadful noise of waters in mine ears! <END>
what ugly sights of death within mine eyes! <END>
methought i saw a thousand fearful wrecks; <END>
ten thousand men that fishes gnaw'd upon; <END>
wedges of gold, great anchors, heaps of pearl, <END>
inestimable stones, unvalued jewels, <END>
all scatter'd in the bottom of the sea: <END>
some lay in dead men's skulls; and, in those holes <END>
where eyes did once inhabit, there were crept, <END>
as 'twere in scorn of eyes, reflecting gems, <END>
which woo'd the slimy bottom of the deep, <END>
and mock'd the dead bones that lay scatter'd by. <END>
had you such leisure in the time of death <END>
to gaze upon the secrets of the deep? <END>
methought i had; and often did i strive <END>
to yield the ghost: but still the envious flood <END>
kept in my soul, and would not let it forth <END>
to seek the empty, vast and wandering air; <END>
but smother'd it within my panting bulk, <END>
which almost burst to belch it in the sea. <END>
awaked you not with this sore agony? <END>
o, no, my dream was lengthen'd after life; <END>
o, then began the tempest to my soul, <END>
who pass'd, methought, the melancholy flood, <END>
with that grim ferryman which poets write of, <END>
unto the kingdom of perpetual night. <END>
the first that there did greet my stranger soul, <END>
was my great father-in-law, renowned warwick; <END>
who cried aloud, 'what scourge for perjury <END>
can this dark monarchy afford false clarence?' <END>
and so he vanish'd: then came wandering by <END>
a shadow like an angel, with bright hair <END>
dabbled in blood; and he squeak'd out aloud, <END>
'clarence is come; false, fleeting, perjured clarence, <END>
that stabb'd me in the field by tewksbury; <END>
seize on him, furies, take him to your torments!' <END>
with that, methoughts, a legion of foul fiends <END>
environ'd me about, and howled in mine ears <END>
such hideous cries, that with the very noise <END>
i trembling waked, and for a season after <END>
could not believe but that i was in hell, <END>
such terrible impression made the dream. <END>
no marvel, my lord, though it affrighted you; <END>
i promise, i am afraid to hear you tell it. <END>
o brakenbury, i have done those things, <END>
which now bear evidence against my soul, <END>
for edward's sake; and see how he requites me! <END>
o god! if my deep prayers cannot appease thee, <END>
but thou wilt be avenged on my misdeeds, <END>
yet execute thy wrath in me alone, <END>
o, spare my guiltless wife and my poor children! <END>
i pray thee, gentle keeper, stay by me; <END>
my soul is heavy, and i fain would sleep. <END>
i will, my lord: god give your grace good rest! <END>
sorrow breaks seasons and reposing hours, <END>
makes the night morning, and the noon-tide night. <END>
princes have but their tides for their glories, <END>
an outward honour for an inward toil; <END>
and, for unfelt imagination, <END>
they often feel a world of restless cares: <END>
so that, betwixt their tides and low names, <END>
there's nothing differs but the outward fame. <END>
ho! who's here? <END>
in god's name what are you, and how came you hither? <END>
i would speak with clarence, and i came hither on my legs. <END>
yea, are you so brief? <END>
o sir, it is better to be brief than tedious. show <END>
him our commission; talk no more. <END>
i am, in this, commanded to deliver <END>
the noble duke of clarence to your hands: <END>
i will not reason what is meant hereby, <END>
because i will be guiltless of the meaning. <END>
here are the keys, there sits the duke asleep: <END>
i'll to the king; and signify to him <END>
that thus i have resign'd my charge to you. <END>
do so, it is a point of wisdom: fare you well. <END>
what, shall we stab him as he sleeps? <END>
no; then he will say 'twas done cowardly, when he wakes. <END>
when he wakes! why, fool, he shall never wake till <END>
the judgment-day. <END>
why, then he will say we stabbed him sleeping. <END>
the urging of that word 'judgment' hath bred a kind <END>
of remorse in me. <END>
what, art thou afraid? <END>
not to kill him, having a warrant for it; but to be <END>
damned for killing him, from which no warrant can defend us. <END>
i thought thou hadst been resolute. <END>
so i am, to let him live. <END>
back to the duke of gloucester, tell him so. <END>
i pray thee, stay a while: i hope my holy humour <END>
will change; 'twas wont to hold me but while one <END>
would tell twenty. <END>
how dost thou feel thyself now? <END>
'faith, some certain dregs of conscience are yet <END>
within me. <END>
remember our reward, when the deed is done. <END>
'zounds, he dies: i had forgot the reward. <END>
where is thy conscience now? <END>
in the duke of gloucester's purse. <END>
so when he opens his purse to give us our reward, <END>
thy conscience flies out. <END>
let it go; there's few or none will entertain it. <END>
how if it come to thee again? <END>
i'll not meddle with it: it is a dangerous thing: it <END>
makes a man a coward: a man cannot steal, but it <END>
accuseth him; he cannot swear, but it cheques him; <END>
he cannot lie with his neighbour's wife, but it <END>
detects him: 'tis a blushing shamefast spirit that <END>
mutinies in a man's bosom; it fills one full of <END>
obstacles: it made me once restore a purse of gold <END>
that i found; it beggars any man that keeps it: it <END>
is turned out of all towns and cities for a <END>
dangerous thing; and every man that means to live <END>
well endeavours to trust to himself and to live <END>
without it. <END>
'zounds, it is even now at my elbow, persuading me <END>
not to kill the duke. <END>
take the devil in thy mind, and relieve him not: he <END>
would insinuate with thee but to make thee sigh. <END>
tut, i am strong-framed, he cannot prevail with me, <END>
i warrant thee. <END>
spoke like a tail fellow that respects his <END>
reputation. come, shall we to this gear? <END>
take him over the costard with the hilts of thy <END>
sword, and then we will chop him in the malmsey-butt <END>
in the next room. <END>
o excellent devise! make a sop of him. <END>
hark! he stirs: shall i strike? <END>
no, first let's reason with him. <END>
where art thou, keeper? give me a cup of wine. <END>
second murderer: <END>
you shall have wine enough, my lord, anon. <END>
in god's name, what art thou? <END>
a man, as you are. <END>
but not, as i am, royal. <END>
nor you, as we are, loyal. <END>
thy voice is thunder, but thy looks are humble. <END>
my voice is now the king's, my looks mine own. <END>
how darkly and how deadly dost thou speak! <END>
your eyes do menace me: why look you pale? <END>
who sent you hither? wherefore do you come? <END>
to, to, to-- <END>
to murder me? <END>
ay, ay. <END>
you scarcely have the hearts to tell me so, <END>
and therefore cannot have the hearts to do it. <END>
wherein, my friends, have i offended you? <END>
offended us you have not, but the king. <END>
i shall be reconciled to him again. <END>
never, my lord; therefore prepare to die. <END>
are you call'd forth from out a world of men <END>
to slay the innocent? what is my offence? <END>
where are the evidence that do accuse me? <END>
what lawful quest have given their verdict up <END>
unto the frowning judge? or who pronounced <END>
the bitter sentence of poor clarence' death? <END>
before i be convict by course of law, <END>
to threaten me with death is most unlawful. <END>
i charge you, as you hope to have redemption <END>
by christ's dear blood shed for our grievous sins, <END>
that you depart and lay no hands on me <END>
the deed you undertake is damnable. <END>
what we will do, we do upon command. <END>
and he that hath commanded is the king. <END>
erroneous vassal! the great king of kings <END>
hath in the tables of his law commanded <END>
that thou shalt do no murder: and wilt thou, then, <END>
spurn at his edict and fulfil a man's? <END>
take heed; for he holds vengeance in his hands, <END>
to hurl upon their heads that break his law. <END>
and that same vengeance doth he hurl on thee, <END>
for false forswearing and for murder too: <END>
thou didst receive the holy sacrament, <END>
to fight in quarrel of the house of lancaster. <END>
and, like a traitor to the name of god, <END>
didst break that vow; and with thy treacherous blade <END>
unrip'dst the bowels of thy sovereign's son. <END>
whom thou wert sworn to cherish and defend. <END>
how canst thou urge god's dreadful law to us, <END>
when thou hast broke it in so dear degree? <END>
alas! for whose sake did i that ill deed? <END>
for edward, for my brother, for his sake: why, sirs, <END>
he sends ye not to murder me for this <END>
for in this sin he is as deep as i. <END>
if god will be revenged for this deed. <END>
o, know you yet, he doth it publicly, <END>
take not the quarrel from his powerful arm; <END>
he needs no indirect nor lawless course <END>
to cut off those that have offended him. <END>
who made thee, then, a bloody minister, <END>
when gallant-springing brave plantagenet, <END>
that princely novice, was struck dead by thee? <END>
my brother's love, the devil, and my rage. <END>
thy brother's love, our duty, and thy fault, <END>
provoke us hither now to slaughter thee. <END>
oh, if you love my brother, hate not me; <END>
i am his brother, and i love him well. <END>
if you be hired for meed, go back again, <END>
and i will send you to my brother gloucester, <END>
who shall reward you better for my life <END>
than edward will for tidings of my death. <END>
you are deceived, your brother gloucester hates you. <END>
o, no, he loves me, and he holds me dear: <END>
go you to him from me. <END>
ay, so we will. <END>
tell him, when that our princely father york <END>
bless'd his three sons with his victorious arm, <END>
and charged us from his soul to love each other, <END>
he little thought of this divided friendship: <END>
bid gloucester think of this, and he will weep. <END>
ay, millstones; as be lesson'd us to weep. <END>
o, do not slander him, for he is kind. <END>
right, <END>
as snow in harvest. thou deceivest thyself: <END>
'tis he that sent us hither now to slaughter thee. <END>
it cannot be; for when i parted with him, <END>
he hugg'd me in his arms, and swore, with sobs, <END>
that he would labour my delivery. <END>
why, so he doth, now he delivers thee <END>
from this world's thraldom to the joys of heaven. <END>
make peace with god, for you must die, my lord. <END>
hast thou that holy feeling in thy soul, <END>
to counsel me to make my peace with god, <END>
and art thou yet to thy own soul so blind, <END>
that thou wilt war with god by murdering me? <END>
ah, sirs, consider, he that set you on <END>
to do this deed will hate you for the deed. <END>
what shall we do? <END>
relent, and save your souls. <END>
relent! 'tis cowardly and womanish. <END>
not to relent is beastly, savage, devilish. <END>
which of you, if you were a prince's son, <END>
being pent from liberty, as i am now, <END>
if two such murderers as yourselves came to you, <END>
would not entreat for life? <END>
my friend, i spy some pity in thy looks: <END>
o, if thine eye be not a flatterer, <END>
come thou on my side, and entreat for me, <END>
as you would beg, were you in my distress <END>
a begging prince what beggar pities not? <END>
look behind you, my lord. <END>
take that, and that: if all this will not do, <END>
i'll drown you in the malmsey-butt within. <END>
a bloody deed, and desperately dispatch'd! <END>
how fain, like pilate, would i wash my hands <END>
of this most grievous guilty murder done! <END>
how now! what mean'st thou, that thou help'st me not? <END>
by heavens, the duke shall know how slack thou art! <END>
i would he knew that i had saved his brother! <END>
take thou the fee, and tell him what i say; <END>
for i repent me that the duke is slain. <END>
so do not i: go, coward as thou art. <END>
now must i hide his body in some hole, <END>
until the duke take order for his burial: <END>
and when i have my meed, i must away; <END>
for this will out, and here i must not stay. <END>
why, so: now have i done a good day's work: <END>
you peers, continue this united league: <END>
i every day expect an embassage <END>
from my redeemer to redeem me hence; <END>
and now in peace my soul shall part to heaven, <END>
since i have set my friends at peace on earth. <END>
rivers and hastings, take each other's hand; <END>
dissemble not your hatred, swear your love. <END>
by heaven, my heart is purged from grudging hate: <END>
and with my hand i seal my true heart's love. <END>
so thrive i, as i truly swear the like! <END>
take heed you dally not before your king; <END>
lest he that is the supreme king of kings <END>
confound your hidden falsehood, and award <END>
either of you to be the other's end. <END>
so prosper i, as i swear perfect love! <END>
and i, as i love hastings with my heart! <END>
madam, yourself are not exempt in this, <END>
nor your son dorset, buckingham, nor you; <END>
you have been factious one against the other, <END>
wife, love lord hastings, let him kiss your hand; <END>
and what you do, do it unfeignedly. <END>
here, hastings; i will never more remember <END>
our former hatred, so thrive i and mine! <END>
dorset, embrace him; hastings, love lord marquess. <END>
this interchange of love, i here protest, <END>
upon my part shall be unviolable. <END>
and so swear i, my lord <END>
now, princely buckingham, seal thou this league <END>
with thy embracements to my wife's allies, <END>
and make me happy in your unity. <END>
whenever buckingham doth turn his hate <END>
on you or yours, <END>
but with all duteous love <END>
doth cherish you and yours, god punish me <END>
with hate in those where i expect most love! <END>
when i have most need to employ a friend, <END>
and most assured that he is a friend <END>
deep, hollow, treacherous, and full of guile, <END>
be he unto me! this do i beg of god, <END>
when i am cold in zeal to yours. <END>
a pleasing cordial, princely buckingham, <END>
is this thy vow unto my sickly heart. <END>
there wanteth now our brother gloucester here, <END>
to make the perfect period of this peace. <END>
and, in good time, here comes the noble duke. <END>
good morrow to my sovereign king and queen: <END>
and, princely peers, a happy time of day! <END>
happy, indeed, as we have spent the day. <END>
brother, we done deeds of charity; <END>
made peace enmity, fair love of hate, <END>
between these swelling wrong-incensed peers. <END>
a blessed labour, my most sovereign liege: <END>
amongst this princely heap, if any here, <END>
by false intelligence, or wrong surmise, <END>
hold me a foe; <END>
if i unwittingly, or in my rage, <END>
have aught committed that is hardly borne <END>
by any in this presence, i desire <END>
to reconcile me to his friendly peace: <END>
'tis death to me to be at enmity; <END>
i hate it, and desire all good men's love. <END>
first, madam, i entreat true peace of you, <END>
which i will purchase with my duteous service; <END>
of you, my noble cousin buckingham, <END>
if ever any grudge were lodged between us; <END>
of you, lord rivers, and, lord grey, of you; <END>
that without desert have frown'd on me; <END>
dukes, earls, lords, gentlemen; indeed, of all. <END>
i do not know that englishman alive <END>
with whom my soul is any jot at odds <END>
more than the infant that is born to-night <END>
i thank my god for my humility. <END>
a holy day shall this be kept hereafter: <END>
i would to god all strifes were well compounded. <END>
my sovereign liege, i do beseech your majesty <END>
to take our brother clarence to your grace. <END>
why, madam, have i offer'd love for this <END>
to be so bouted in this royal presence? <END>
who knows not that the noble duke is dead? <END>
you do him injury to scorn his corse. <END>
who knows not he is dead! who knows he is? <END>
all seeing heaven, what a world is this! <END>
look i so pale, lord dorset, as the rest? <END>
ay, my good lord; and no one in this presence <END>
but his red colour hath forsook his cheeks. <END>
is clarence dead? the order was reversed. <END>
but he, poor soul, by your first order died, <END>
and that a winged mercury did bear: <END>
some tardy cripple bore the countermand, <END>
that came too lag to see him buried. <END>
god grant that some, less noble and less loyal, <END>
nearer in bloody thoughts, but not in blood, <END>
deserve not worse than wretched clarence did, <END>
and yet go current from suspicion! <END>
a boon, my sovereign, for my service done! <END>
i pray thee, peace: my soul is full of sorrow. <END>
i will not rise, unless your highness grant. <END>
then speak at once what is it thou demand'st. <END>
the forfeit, sovereign, of my servant's life; <END>
who slew to-day a righteous gentleman <END>
lately attendant on the duke of norfolk. <END>
have a tongue to doom my brother's death, <END>
and shall the same give pardon to a slave? <END>
my brother slew no man; his fault was thought, <END>
and yet his punishment was cruel death. <END>
who sued to me for him? who, in my rage, <END>
kneel'd at my feet, and bade me be advised <END>
who spake of brotherhood? who spake of love? <END>
who told me how the poor soul did forsake <END>
the mighty warwick, and did fight for me? <END>
who told me, in the field by tewksbury <END>
when oxford had me down, he rescued me, <END>
and said, 'dear brother, live, and be a king'? <END>
who told me, when we both lay in the field <END>
frozen almost to death, how he did lap me <END>
even in his own garments, and gave himself, <END>
all thin and naked, to the numb cold night? <END>
all this from my remembrance brutish wrath <END>
sinfully pluck'd, and not a man of you <END>
had so much grace to put it in my mind. <END>
but when your carters or your waiting-vassals <END>
have done a drunken slaughter, and defaced <END>
the precious image of our dear redeemer, <END>
you straight are on your knees for pardon, pardon; <END>
and i unjustly too, must grant it you <END>
but for my brother not a man would speak, <END>
nor i, ungracious, speak unto myself <END>
for him, poor soul. the proudest of you all <END>
have been beholding to him in his life; <END>
yet none of you would once plead for his life. <END>
o god, i fear thy justice will take hold <END>
on me, and you, and mine, and yours for this! <END>
come, hastings, help me to my closet. <END>
oh, poor clarence! <END>
this is the fruit of rashness! mark'd you not <END>
how that the guilty kindred of the queen <END>
look'd pale when they did hear of clarence' death? <END>
o, they did urge it still unto the king! <END>
god will revenge it. but come, let us in, <END>
to comfort edward with our company. <END>
we wait upon your grace. <END>
tell me, good grandam, is our father dead? <END>
no, boy. <END>
why do you wring your hands, and beat your breast, <END>
and cry 'o clarence, my unhappy son!' <END>
why do you look on us, and shake your head, <END>
and call us wretches, orphans, castaways <END>
if that our noble father be alive? <END>
my pretty cousins, you mistake me much; <END>
i do lament the sickness of the king. <END>
as loath to lose him, not your father's death; <END>
it were lost sorrow to wail one that's lost. <END>
then, grandam, you conclude that he is dead. <END>
the king my uncle is to blame for this: <END>
god will revenge it; whom i will importune <END>
with daily prayers all to that effect. <END>
and so will i. <END>
peace, children, peace! the king doth love you well: <END>
incapable and shallow innocents, <END>
you cannot guess who caused your father's death. <END>
grandam, we can; for my good uncle gloucester <END>
told me, the king, provoked by the queen, <END>
devised impeachments to imprison him : <END>
and when my uncle told me so, he wept, <END>
and hugg'd me in his arm, and kindly kiss'd my cheek; <END>
bade me rely on him as on my father, <END>
and he would love me dearly as his child. <END>
oh, that deceit should steal such gentle shapes, <END>
and with a virtuous vizard hide foul guile! <END>
he is my son; yea, and therein my shame; <END>
yet from my dugs he drew not this deceit. <END>
think you my uncle did dissemble, grandam? <END>
ay, boy. <END>
i cannot think it. hark! what noise is this? <END>
oh, who shall hinder me to wail and weep, <END>
to chide my fortune, and torment myself? <END>
i'll join with black despair against my soul, <END>
and to myself become an enemy. <END>
what means this scene of rude impatience? <END>
to make an act of tragic violence: <END>
edward, my lord, your son, our king, is dead. <END>
why grow the branches now the root is wither'd? <END>
why wither not the leaves the sap being gone? <END>
if you will live, lament; if die, be brief, <END>
that our swift-winged souls may catch the king's; <END>
or, like obedient subjects, follow him <END>
to his new kingdom of perpetual rest. <END>
ah, so much interest have i in thy sorrow <END>
as i had title in thy noble husband! <END>
i have bewept a worthy husband's death, <END>
and lived by looking on his images: <END>
but now two mirrors of his princely semblance <END>
are crack'd in pieces by malignant death, <END>
and i for comfort have but one false glass, <END>
which grieves me when i see my shame in him. <END>
thou art a widow; yet thou art a mother, <END>
and hast the comfort of thy children left thee: <END>
but death hath snatch'd my husband from mine arms, <END>
and pluck'd two crutches from my feeble limbs, <END>
edward and clarence. o, what cause have i, <END>
thine being but a moiety of my grief, <END>
to overgo thy plaints and drown thy cries! <END>
good aunt, you wept not for our father's death; <END>
how can we aid you with our kindred tears? <END>
our fatherless distress was left unmoan'd; <END>
your widow-dolour likewise be unwept! <END>
give me no help in lamentation; <END>
i am not barren to bring forth complaints <END>
all springs reduce their currents to mine eyes, <END>
that i, being govern'd by the watery moon, <END>
may send forth plenteous tears to drown the world! <END>
oh for my husband, for my dear lord edward! <END>
oh for our father, for our dear lord clarence! <END>
alas for both, both mine, edward and clarence! <END>
what stay had i but edward? and he's gone. <END>
what stay had we but clarence? and he's gone. <END>
what stays had i but they? and they are gone. <END>
was never widow had so dear a loss! <END>
were never orphans had so dear a loss! <END>
was never mother had so dear a loss! <END>
alas, i am the mother of these moans! <END>
their woes are parcell'd, mine are general. <END>
she for an edward weeps, and so do i; <END>
i for a clarence weep, so doth not she: <END>
these babes for clarence weep and so do i; <END>
i for an edward weep, so do not they: <END>
alas, you three, on me, threefold distress'd, <END>
pour all your tears! i am your sorrow's nurse, <END>
and i will pamper it with lamentations. <END>
comfort, dear mother: god is much displeased <END>
that you take with unthankfulness, his doing: <END>
in common worldly things, 'tis call'd ungrateful, <END>
with dull unwilligness to repay a debt <END>
which with a bounteous hand was kindly lent; <END>
much more to be thus opposite with heaven, <END>
for it requires the royal debt it lent you. <END>
madam, bethink you, like a careful mother, <END>
of the young prince your son: send straight for him <END>
let him be crown'd; in him your comfort lives: <END>
drown desperate sorrow in dead edward's grave, <END>
and plant your joys in living edward's throne. <END>
madam, have comfort: all of us have cause <END>
to wail the dimming of our shining star; <END>
but none can cure their harms by wailing them. <END>
madam, my mother, i do cry you mercy; <END>
i did not see your grace: humbly on my knee <END>
i crave your blessing. <END>
god bless thee; and put meekness in thy mind, <END>
love, charity, obedience, and true duty! <END>
you cloudy princes and heart-sorrowing peers, <END>
that bear this mutual heavy load of moan, <END>
now cheer each other in each other's love <END>
though we have spent our harvest of this king, <END>
we are to reap the harvest of his son. <END>
the broken rancour of your high-swoln hearts, <END>
but lately splinter'd, knit, and join'd together, <END>
must gently be preserved, cherish'd, and kept: <END>
me seemeth good, that, with some little train, <END>
forthwith from ludlow the young prince be fetch'd <END>
hither to london, to be crown'd our king. <END>
why with some little train, my lord of buckingham? <END>
marry, my lord, lest, by a multitude, <END>
the new-heal'd wound of malice should break out, <END>
which would be so much the more dangerous <END>
by how much the estate is green and yet ungovern'd: <END>
where every horse bears his commanding rein, <END>
and may direct his course as please himself, <END>
as well the fear of harm, as harm apparent, <END>
in my opinion, ought to be prevented. <END>
i hope the king made peace with all of us <END>
and the compact is firm and true in me. <END>
and so in me; and so, i think, in all: <END>
yet, since it is but green, it should be put <END>
to no apparent likelihood of breach, <END>
which haply by much company might be urged: <END>
therefore i say with noble buckingham, <END>
that it is meet so few should fetch the prince. <END>
and so say i. <END>
then be it so; and go we to determine <END>
who they shall be that straight shall post to ludlow. <END>
madam, and you, my mother, will you go <END>
to give your censures in this weighty business? <END>
with all our harts. <END>
my lord, whoever journeys to the prince, <END>
for god's sake, let not us two be behind; <END>
for, by the way, i'll sort occasion, <END>
as index to the story we late talk'd of, <END>
to part the queen's proud kindred from the king. <END>
my other self, my counsel's consistory, <END>
my oracle, my prophet! my dear cousin, <END>
i, like a child, will go by thy direction. <END>
towards ludlow then, for we'll not stay behind. <END>
neighbour, well met: whither away so fast? <END>
i promise you, i scarcely know myself: <END>
hear you the news abroad? <END>
ay, that the king is dead. <END>
bad news, by'r lady; seldom comes the better: <END>
i fear, i fear 'twill prove a troublous world. <END>
neighbours, god speed! <END>
give you good morrow, sir. <END>
doth this news hold of good king edward's death? <END>
ay, sir, it is too true; god help the while! <END>
then, masters, look to see a troublous world. <END>
no, no; by god's good grace his son shall reign. <END>
woe to the land that's govern'd by a child! <END>
in him there is a hope of government, <END>
that in his nonage council under him, <END>
and in his full and ripen'd years himself, <END>
no doubt, shall then and till then govern well. <END>
so stood the state when henry the sixth <END>
was crown'd in paris but at nine months old. <END>
stood the state so? no, no, good friends, god wot; <END>
for then this land was famously enrich'd <END>
with politic grave counsel; then the king <END>
had virtuous uncles to protect his grace. <END>
why, so hath this, both by the father and mother. <END>
better it were they all came by the father, <END>
or by the father there were none at all; <END>
for emulation now, who shall be nearest, <END>
will touch us all too near, if god prevent not. <END>
o, full of danger is the duke of gloucester! <END>
and the queen's sons and brothers haught and proud: <END>
and were they to be ruled, and not to rule, <END>
this sickly land might solace as before. <END>
come, come, we fear the worst; all shall be well. <END>
when clouds appear, wise men put on their cloaks; <END>
when great leaves fall, the winter is at hand; <END>
when the sun sets, who doth not look for night? <END>
untimely storms make men expect a dearth. <END>
all may be well; but, if god sort it so, <END>
'tis more than we deserve, or i expect. <END>
truly, the souls of men are full of dread: <END>
ye cannot reason almost with a man <END>
that looks not heavily and full of fear. <END>
before the times of change, still is it so: <END>
by a divine instinct men's minds mistrust <END>
ensuing dangers; as by proof, we see <END>
the waters swell before a boisterous storm. <END>
but leave it all to god. whither away? <END>
marry, we were sent for to the justices. <END>
and so was i: i'll bear you company. <END>
last night, i hear, they lay at northampton; <END>
at stony-stratford will they be to-night: <END>
to-morrow, or next day, they will be here. <END>
i long with all my heart to see the prince: <END>
i hope he is much grown since last i saw him. <END>
but i hear, no; they say my son of york <END>
hath almost overta'en him in his growth. <END>
ay, mother; but i would not have it so. <END>
why, my young cousin, it is good to grow. <END>
grandam, one night, as we did sit at supper, <END>
my uncle rivers talk'd how i did grow <END>
more than my brother: 'ay,' quoth my uncle <END>
gloucester, <END>
'small herbs have grace, great weeds do grow apace:' <END>
and since, methinks, i would not grow so fast, <END>
because sweet flowers are slow and weeds make haste. <END>
good faith, good faith, the saying did not hold <END>
in him that did object the same to thee; <END>
he was the wretched'st thing when he was young, <END>
so long a-growing and so leisurely, <END>
that, if this rule were true, he should be gracious. <END>
why, madam, so, no doubt, he is. <END>
i hope he is; but yet let mothers doubt. <END>
now, by my troth, if i had been remember'd, <END>
i could have given my uncle's grace a flout, <END>
to touch his growth nearer than he touch'd mine. <END>
how, my pretty york? i pray thee, let me hear it. <END>
marry, they say my uncle grew so fast <END>
that he could gnaw a crust at two hours old <END>
'twas full two years ere i could get a tooth. <END>
grandam, this would have been a biting jest. <END>
i pray thee, pretty york, who told thee this? <END>
grandam, his nurse. <END>
his nurse! why, she was dead ere thou wert born. <END>
if 'twere not she, i cannot tell who told me. <END>
a parlous boy: go to, you are too shrewd. <END>
good madam, be not angry with the child. <END>
pitchers have ears. <END>
here comes a messenger. what news? <END>
such news, my lord, as grieves me to unfold. <END>
how fares the prince? <END>
well, madam, and in health. <END>
what is thy news then? <END>
lord rivers and lord grey are sent to pomfret, <END>
with them sir thomas vaughan, prisoners. <END>
who hath committed them? <END>
the mighty dukes <END>
gloucester and buckingham. <END>
for what offence? <END>
the sum of all i can, i have disclosed; <END>
why or for what these nobles were committed <END>
is all unknown to me, my gracious lady. <END>
ay me, i see the downfall of our house! <END>
the tiger now hath seized the gentle hind; <END>
insulting tyranny begins to jet <END>
upon the innocent and aweless throne: <END>
welcome, destruction, death, and massacre! <END>
i see, as in a map, the end of all. <END>
accursed and unquiet wrangling days, <END>
how many of you have mine eyes beheld! <END>
my husband lost his life to get the crown; <END>
and often up and down my sons were toss'd, <END>
for me to joy and weep their gain and loss: <END>
and being seated, and domestic broils <END>
clean over-blown, themselves, the conquerors. <END>
make war upon themselves; blood against blood, <END>
self against self: o, preposterous <END>
and frantic outrage, end thy damned spleen; <END>
or let me die, to look on death no more! <END>
come, come, my boy; we will to sanctuary. <END>
madam, farewell. <END>
i'll go along with you. <END>
you have no cause. <END>
my gracious lady, go; <END>
and thither bear your treasure and your goods. <END>
for my part, i'll resign unto your grace <END>
the seal i keep: and so betide to me <END>
as well i tender you and all of yours! <END>
come, i'll conduct you to the sanctuary. <END>
welcome, sweet prince, to london, to your chamber. <END>
welcome, dear cousin, my thoughts' sovereign <END>
the weary way hath made you melancholy. <END>
no, uncle; but our crosses on the way <END>
have made it tedious, wearisome, and heavy <END>
i want more uncles here to welcome me. <END>
sweet prince, the untainted virtue of your years <END>
hath not yet dived into the world's deceit <END>
nor more can you distinguish of a man <END>
than of his outward show; which, god he knows, <END>
seldom or never jumpeth with the heart. <END>
those uncles which you want were dangerous; <END>
your grace attended to their sugar'd words, <END>
but look'd not on the poison of their hearts : <END>
god keep you from them, and from such false friends! <END>
god keep me from false friends! but they were none. <END>
my lord, the mayor of london comes to greet you. <END>
god bless your grace with health and happy days! <END>
i thank you, good my lord; and thank you all. <END>
i thought my mother, and my brother york, <END>
would long ere this have met us on the way <END>
fie, what a slug is hastings, that he comes not <END>
to tell us whether they will come or no! <END>
and, in good time, here comes the sweating lord. <END>
welcome, my lord: what, will our mother come? <END>
on what occasion, god he knows, not i, <END>
the queen your mother, and your brother york, <END>
have taken sanctuary: the tender prince <END>
would fain have come with me to meet your grace, <END>
but by his mother was perforce withheld. <END>
fie, what an indirect and peevish course <END>
is this of hers! lord cardinal, will your grace <END>
persuade the queen to send the duke of york <END>
unto his princely brother presently? <END>
if she deny, lord hastings, go with him, <END>
and from her jealous arms pluck him perforce. <END>
my lord of buckingham, if my weak oratory <END>
can from his mother win the duke of york, <END>
anon expect him here; but if she be obdurate <END>
to mild entreaties, god in heaven forbid <END>
we should infringe the holy privilege <END>
of blessed sanctuary! not for all this land <END>
would i be guilty of so deep a sin. <END>
you are too senseless--obstinate, my lord, <END>
too ceremonious and traditional <END>
weigh it but with the grossness of this age, <END>
you break not sanctuary in seizing him. <END>
the benefit thereof is always granted <END>
to those whose dealings have deserved the place, <END>
and those who have the wit to claim the place: <END>
this prince hath neither claim'd it nor deserved it; <END>
and therefore, in mine opinion, cannot have it: <END>
then, taking him from thence that is not there, <END>
you break no privilege nor charter there. <END>
oft have i heard of sanctuary men; <END>
but sanctuary children ne'er till now. <END>
my lord, you shall o'er-rule my mind for once. <END>
come on, lord hastings, will you go with me? <END>
i go, my lord. <END>
good lords, make all the speedy haste you may. <END>
say, uncle gloucester, if our brother come, <END>
where shall we sojourn till our coronation? <END>
where it seems best unto your royal self. <END>
if i may counsel you, some day or two <END>
your highness shall repose you at the tower: <END>
then where you please, and shall be thought most fit <END>
for your best health and recreation. <END>
i do not like the tower, of any place. <END>
did julius caesar build that place, my lord? <END>
he did, my gracious lord, begin that place; <END>
which, since, succeeding ages have re-edified. <END>
is it upon record, or else reported <END>
successively from age to age, he built it? <END>
upon record, my gracious lord. <END>
but say, my lord, it were not register'd, <END>
methinks the truth should live from age to age, <END>
as 'twere retail'd to all posterity, <END>
even to the general all-ending day. <END>
what say you, uncle? <END>
i say, without characters, fame lives long. <END>
thus, like the formal vice, iniquity, <END>
i moralize two meanings in one word. <END>
that julius caesar was a famous man; <END>
with what his valour did enrich his wit, <END>
his wit set down to make his valour live <END>
death makes no conquest of this conqueror; <END>
for now he lives in fame, though not in life. <END>
i'll tell you what, my cousin buckingham,-- <END>
what, my gracious lord? <END>
an if i live until i be a man, <END>
i'll win our ancient right in france again, <END>
or die a soldier, as i lived a king. <END>
now, in good time, here comes the duke of york. <END>
richard of york! how fares our loving brother? <END>
well, my dread lord; so must i call you now. <END>
ay, brother, to our grief, as it is yours: <END>
too late he died that might have kept that title, <END>
which by his death hath lost much majesty. <END>
how fares our cousin, noble lord of york? <END>
i thank you, gentle uncle. o, my lord, <END>
you said that idle weeds are fast in growth <END>
the prince my brother hath outgrown me far. <END>
he hath, my lord. <END>
and therefore is he idle? <END>
o, my fair cousin, i must not say so. <END>
then is he more beholding to you than i. <END>
he may command me as my sovereign; <END>
but you have power in me as in a kinsman. <END>
i pray you, uncle, give me this dagger. <END>
my dagger, little cousin? with all my heart. <END>
a beggar, brother? <END>
of my kind uncle, that i know will give; <END>
and being but a toy, which is no grief to give. <END>
a greater gift than that i'll give my cousin. <END>
a greater gift! o, that's the sword to it. <END>
a gentle cousin, were it light enough. <END>
o, then, i see, you will part but with light gifts; <END>
in weightier things you'll say a beggar nay. <END>
it is too heavy for your grace to wear. <END>
i weigh it lightly, were it heavier. <END>
what, would you have my weapon, little lord? <END>
i would, that i might thank you as you call me. <END>
how? <END>
little. <END>
my lord of york will still be cross in talk: <END>
uncle, your grace knows how to bear with him. <END>
you mean, to bear me, not to bear with me: <END>
uncle, my brother mocks both you and me; <END>
because that i am little, like an ape, <END>
he thinks that you should bear me on your shoulders. <END>
with what a sharp-provided wit he reasons! <END>
to mitigate the scorn he gives his uncle, <END>
he prettily and aptly taunts himself: <END>
so cunning and so young is wonderful. <END>
my lord, will't please you pass along? <END>
myself and my good cousin buckingham <END>
will to your mother, to entreat of her <END>
to meet you at the tower and welcome you. <END>
what, will you go unto the tower, my lord? <END>
my lord protector needs will have it so. <END>
i shall not sleep in quiet at the tower. <END>
why, what should you fear? <END>
marry, my uncle clarence' angry ghost: <END>
my grandam told me he was murdered there. <END>
i fear no uncles dead. <END>
nor none that live, i hope. <END>
an if they live, i hope i need not fear. <END>
but come, my lord; and with a heavy heart, <END>
thinking on them, go i unto the tower. <END>
think you, my lord, this little prating york <END>
was not incensed by his subtle mother <END>
to taunt and scorn you thus opprobriously? <END>
no doubt, no doubt; o, 'tis a parlous boy; <END>
bold, quick, ingenious, forward, capable <END>
he is all the mother's, from the top to toe. <END>
well, let them rest. come hither, catesby. <END>
thou art sworn as deeply to effect what we intend <END>
as closely to conceal what we impart: <END>
thou know'st our reasons urged upon the way; <END>
what think'st thou? is it not an easy matter <END>
to make william lord hastings of our mind, <END>
for the instalment of this noble duke <END>
in the seat royal of this famous isle? <END>
he for his father's sake so loves the prince, <END>
that he will not be won to aught against him. <END>
what think'st thou, then, of stanley? what will he? <END>
he will do all in all as hastings doth. <END>
well, then, no more but this: go, gentle catesby, <END>
and, as it were far off sound thou lord hastings, <END>
how doth he stand affected to our purpose; <END>
and summon him to-morrow to the tower, <END>
to sit about the coronation. <END>
if thou dost find him tractable to us, <END>
encourage him, and show him all our reasons: <END>
if he be leaden, icy-cold, unwilling, <END>
be thou so too; and so break off your talk, <END>
and give us notice of his inclination: <END>
for we to-morrow hold divided councils, <END>
wherein thyself shalt highly be employ'd. <END>
commend me to lord william: tell him, catesby, <END>
his ancient knot of dangerous adversaries <END>
to-morrow are let blood at pomfret-castle; <END>
and bid my friend, for joy of this good news, <END>
give mistress shore one gentle kiss the more. <END>
good catesby, go, effect this business soundly. <END>
my good lords both, with all the heed i may. <END>
shall we hear from you, catesby, ere we sleep? <END>
you shall, my lord. <END>
at crosby place, there shall you find us both. <END>
now, my lord, what shall we do, if we perceive <END>
lord hastings will not yield to our complots? <END>
chop off his head, man; somewhat we will do: <END>
and, look, when i am king, claim thou of me <END>
the earldom of hereford, and the moveables <END>
whereof the king my brother stood possess'd. <END>
i'll claim that promise at your grace's hands. <END>
and look to have it yielded with all willingness. <END>
come, let us sup betimes, that afterwards <END>
we may digest our complots in some form. <END>
what, ho! my lord! <END>
a messenger from the lord stanley. <END>
what is't o'clock? <END>
upon the stroke of four. <END>
cannot thy master sleep these tedious nights? <END>
so it should seem by that i have to say. <END>
first, he commends him to your noble lordship. <END>
and then? <END>
and then he sends you word <END>
he dreamt to-night the boar had razed his helm: <END>
besides, he says there are two councils held; <END>
and that may be determined at the one <END>
which may make you and him to rue at the other. <END>
therefore he sends to know your lordship's pleasure, <END>
if presently you will take horse with him, <END>
and with all speed post with him toward the north, <END>
to shun the danger that his soul divines. <END>
go, fellow, go, return unto thy lord; <END>
bid him not fear the separated councils <END>
his honour and myself are at the one, <END>
and at the other is my servant catesby <END>
where nothing can proceed that toucheth us <END>
whereof i shall not have intelligence. <END>
tell him his fears are shallow, wanting instance: <END>
and for his dreams, i wonder he is so fond <END>
to trust the mockery of unquiet slumbers <END>
to fly the boar before the boar pursues, <END>
were to incense the boar to follow us <END>
and make pursuit where he did mean no chase. <END>
go, bid thy master rise and come to me <END>
and we will both together to the tower, <END>
where, he shall see, the boar will use us kindly. <END>
my gracious lord, i'll tell him what you say. <END>
many good morrows to my noble lord! <END>
good morrow, catesby; you are early stirring <END>
what news, what news, in this our tottering state? <END>
it is a reeling world, indeed, my lord; <END>
and i believe twill never stand upright <END>
tim richard wear the garland of the realm. <END>
how! wear the garland! dost thou mean the crown? <END>
ay, my good lord. <END>
i'll have this crown of mine cut from my shoulders <END>
ere i will see the crown so foul misplaced. <END>
but canst thou guess that he doth aim at it? <END>
ay, on my life; and hopes to find forward <END>
upon his party for the gain thereof: <END>
and thereupon he sends you this good news, <END>
that this same very day your enemies, <END>
the kindred of the queen, must die at pomfret. <END>
indeed, i am no mourner for that news, <END>
because they have been still mine enemies: <END>
but, that i'll give my voice on richard's side, <END>
to bar my master's heirs in true descent, <END>
god knows i will not do it, to the death. <END>
god keep your lordship in that gracious mind! <END>
but i shall laugh at this a twelve-month hence, <END>
that they who brought me in my master's hate <END>
i live to look upon their tragedy. <END>
i tell thee, catesby-- <END>
what, my lord? <END>
ere a fortnight make me elder, <END>
i'll send some packing that yet think not on it. <END>
'tis a vile thing to die, my gracious lord, <END>
when men are unprepared and look not for it. <END>
o monstrous, monstrous! and so falls it out <END>
with rivers, vaughan, grey: and so 'twill do <END>
with some men else, who think themselves as safe <END>
as thou and i; who, as thou know'st, are dear <END>
to princely richard and to buckingham. <END>
the princes both make high account of you; <END>
for they account his head upon the bridge. <END>
i know they do; and i have well deserved it. <END>
come on, come on; where is your boar-spear, man? <END>
fear you the boar, and go so unprovided? <END>
my lord, good morrow; good morrow, catesby: <END>
you may jest on, but, by the holy rood, <END>
i do not like these several councils, i. <END>
my lord, <END>
i hold my life as dear as you do yours; <END>
and never in my life, i do protest, <END>
was it more precious to me than 'tis now: <END>
think you, but that i know our state secure, <END>
i would be so triumphant as i am? <END>
the lords at pomfret, when they rode from london, <END>
were jocund, and supposed their state was sure, <END>
and they indeed had no cause to mistrust; <END>
but yet, you see how soon the day o'ercast. <END>
this sudden stag of rancour i misdoubt: <END>
pray god, i say, i prove a needless coward! <END>
what, shall we toward the tower? the day is spent. <END>
come, come, have with you. wot you what, my lord? <END>
to-day the lords you talk of are beheaded. <END>
they, for their truth, might better wear their heads <END>
than some that have accused them wear their hats. <END>
but come, my lord, let us away. <END>
go on before; i'll talk with this good fellow. <END>
how now, sirrah! how goes the world with thee? <END>
the better that your lordship please to ask. <END>
i tell thee, man, 'tis better with me now <END>
than when i met thee last where now we meet: <END>
then was i going prisoner to the tower, <END>
by the suggestion of the queen's allies; <END>
but now, i tell thee--keep it to thyself-- <END>
this day those enemies are put to death, <END>
and i in better state than e'er i was. <END>
god hold it, to your honour's good content! <END>
gramercy, fellow: there, drink that for me. <END>
god save your lordship! <END>
well met, my lord; i am glad to see your honour. <END>
i thank thee, good sir john, with all my heart. <END>
i am in your debt for your last exercise; <END>
come the next sabbath, and i will content you. <END>
what, talking with a priest, lord chamberlain? <END>
your friends at pomfret, they do need the priest; <END>
your honour hath no shriving work in hand. <END>
good faith, and when i met this holy man, <END>
those men you talk of came into my mind. <END>
what, go you toward the tower? <END>
i do, my lord; but long i shall not stay <END>
i shall return before your lordship thence. <END>
'tis like enough, for i stay dinner there. <END>
i'll wait upon your lordship. <END>
come, bring forth the prisoners. <END>
sir richard ratcliff, let me tell thee this: <END>
to-day shalt thou behold a subject die <END>
for truth, for duty, and for loyalty. <END>
god keep the prince from all the pack of you! <END>
a knot you are of damned blood-suckers! <END>
you live that shall cry woe for this after. <END>
dispatch; the limit of your lives is out. <END>
o pomfret, pomfret! o thou bloody prison, <END>
fatal and ominous to noble peers! <END>
within the guilty closure of thy walls <END>
richard the second here was hack'd to death; <END>
and, for more slander to thy dismal seat, <END>
we give thee up our guiltless blood to drink. <END>
now margaret's curse is fall'n upon our heads, <END>
for standing by when richard stabb'd her son. <END>
then cursed she hastings, then cursed she buckingham, <END>
then cursed she richard. o, remember, god <END>
to hear her prayers for them, as now for us <END>
and for my sister and her princely sons, <END>
be satisfied, dear god, with our true blood, <END>
which, as thou know'st, unjustly must be spilt. <END>
make haste; the hour of death is expiate. <END>
come, grey, come, vaughan, let us all embrace: <END>
and take our leave, until we meet in heaven. <END>
my lords, at once: the cause why we are met <END>
is, to determine of the coronation. <END>
in god's name, speak: when is the royal day? <END>
are all things fitting for that royal time? <END>
it is, and wants but nomination. <END>
to-morrow, then, i judge a happy day. <END>
who knows the lord protector's mind herein? <END>
who is most inward with the royal duke? <END>
your grace, we think, should soonest know his mind. <END>
who, i, my lord i we know each other's faces, <END>
but for our hearts, he knows no more of mine, <END>
than i of yours; <END>
nor i no more of his, than you of mine. <END>
lord hastings, you and he are near in love. <END>
i thank his grace, i know he loves me well; <END>
but, for his purpose in the coronation. <END>
i have not sounded him, nor he deliver'd <END>
his gracious pleasure any way therein: <END>
but you, my noble lords, may name the time; <END>
and in the duke's behalf i'll give my voice, <END>
which, i presume, he'll take in gentle part. <END>
now in good time, here comes the duke himself. <END>
my noble lords and cousins all, good morrow. <END>
i have been long a sleeper; but, i hope, <END>
my absence doth neglect no great designs, <END>
which by my presence might have been concluded. <END>
had not you come upon your cue, my lord <END>
william lord hastings had pronounced your part,-- <END>
i mean, your voice,--for crowning of the king. <END>
than my lord hastings no man might be bolder; <END>
his lordship knows me well, and loves me well. <END>
i thank your grace. <END>
my lord of ely! <END>
my lord? <END>
when i was last in holborn, <END>
i saw good strawberries in your garden there <END>
i do beseech you send for some of them. <END>
marry, and will, my lord, with all my heart. <END>
cousin of buckingham, a word with you. <END>
catesby hath sounded hastings in our business, <END>
and finds the testy gentleman so hot, <END>
as he will lose his head ere give consent <END>
his master's son, as worshipful as he terms it, <END>
shall lose the royalty of england's throne. <END>
withdraw you hence, my lord, i'll follow you. <END>
we have not yet set down this day of triumph. <END>
to-morrow, in mine opinion, is too sudden; <END>
for i myself am not so well provided <END>
as else i would be, were the day prolong'd. <END>
where is my lord protector? i have sent for these <END>
strawberries. <END>
his grace looks cheerfully and smooth to-day; <END>
there's some conceit or other likes him well, <END>
when he doth bid good morrow with such a spirit. <END>
i think there's never a man in christendom <END>
that can less hide his love or hate than he; <END>
for by his face straight shall you know his heart. <END>
what of his heart perceive you in his face <END>
by any likelihood he show'd to-day? <END>
marry, that with no man here he is offended; <END>
for, were he, he had shown it in his looks. <END>
i pray god he be not, i say. <END>
i pray you all, tell me what they deserve <END>
that do conspire my death with devilish plots <END>
of damned witchcraft, and that have prevail'd <END>
upon my body with their hellish charms? <END>
the tender love i bear your grace, my lord, <END>
makes me most forward in this noble presence <END>
to doom the offenders, whatsoever they be <END>
i say, my lord, they have deserved death. <END>
then be your eyes the witness of this ill: <END>
see how i am bewitch'd; behold mine arm <END>
is, like a blasted sapling, wither'd up: <END>
and this is edward's wife, that monstrous witch, <END>
consorted with that harlot strumpet shore, <END>
that by their witchcraft thus have marked me. <END>
if they have done this thing, my gracious lord-- <END>
if i thou protector of this damned strumpet-- <END>
tellest thou me of 'ifs'?  thou art a traitor: <END>
off with his head! now, by saint paul i swear, <END>
i will not dine until i see the same. <END>
lovel and ratcliff, look that it be done: <END>
the rest, that love me, rise and follow me. <END>
woe, woe for england! not a whit for me; <END>
for i, too fond, might have prevented this. <END>
stanley did dream the boar did raze his helm; <END>
but i disdain'd it, and did scorn to fly: <END>
three times to-day my foot-cloth horse did stumble, <END>
and startled, when he look'd upon the tower, <END>
as loath to bear me to the slaughter-house. <END>
o, now i want the priest that spake to me: <END>
i now repent i told the pursuivant <END>
as 'twere triumphing at mine enemies, <END>
how they at pomfret bloodily were butcher'd, <END>
and i myself secure in grace and favour. <END>
o margaret, margaret, now thy heavy curse <END>
is lighted on poor hastings' wretched head! <END>
dispatch, my lord; the duke would be at dinner: <END>
make a short shrift; he longs to see your head. <END>
o momentary grace of mortal men, <END>
which we more hunt for than the grace of god! <END>
who builds his hopes in air of your good looks, <END>
lives like a drunken sailor on a mast, <END>
ready, with every nod, to tumble down <END>
into the fatal bowels of the deep. <END>
come, come, dispatch; 'tis bootless to exclaim. <END>
o bloody richard! miserable england! <END>
i prophesy the fearful'st time to thee <END>
that ever wretched age hath look'd upon. <END>
come, lead me to the block; bear him my head. <END>
they smile at me that shortly shall be dead. <END>
come, cousin, canst thou quake, and change thy colour, <END>
murder thy breath in the middle of a word, <END>
and then begin again, and stop again, <END>
as if thou wert distraught and mad with terror? <END>
tut, i can counterfeit the deep tragedian; <END>
speak and look back, and pry on every side, <END>
tremble and start at wagging of a straw, <END>
intending deep suspicion: ghastly looks <END>
are at my service, like enforced smiles; <END>
and both are ready in their offices, <END>
at any time, to grace my stratagems. <END>
but what, is catesby gone? <END>
he is; and, see, he brings the mayor along. <END>
lord mayor,-- <END>
look to the drawbridge there! <END>
hark! a drum. <END>
catesby, o'erlook the walls. <END>
lord mayor, the reason we have sent-- <END>
look back, defend thee, here are enemies. <END>
god and our innocency defend and guard us! <END>
be patient, they are friends, ratcliff and lovel. <END>
here is the head of that ignoble traitor, <END>
the dangerous and unsuspected hastings. <END>
so dear i loved the man, that i must weep. <END>
i took him for the plainest harmless creature <END>
that breathed upon this earth a christian; <END>
made him my book wherein my soul recorded <END>
the history of all her secret thoughts: <END>
so smooth he daub'd his vice with show of virtue, <END>
that, his apparent open guilt omitted, <END>
i mean, his conversation with shore's wife, <END>
he lived from all attainder of suspect. <END>
well, well, he was the covert'st shelter'd traitor <END>
that ever lived. <END>
would you imagine, or almost believe, <END>
were't not that, by great preservation, <END>
we live to tell it you, the subtle traitor <END>
this day had plotted, in the council-house <END>
to murder me and my good lord of gloucester? <END>
what, had he so? <END>
what, think you we are turks or infidels? <END>
or that we would, against the form of law, <END>
proceed thus rashly to the villain's death, <END>
but that the extreme peril of the case, <END>
the peace of england and our persons' safety, <END>
enforced us to this execution? <END>
now, fair befall you! he deserved his death; <END>
and you my good lords, both have well proceeded, <END>
to warn false traitors from the like attempts. <END>
i never look'd for better at his hands, <END>
after he once fell in with mistress shore. <END>
yet had not we determined he should die, <END>
until your lordship came to see his death; <END>
which now the loving haste of these our friends, <END>
somewhat against our meaning, have prevented: <END>
because, my lord, we would have had you heard <END>
the traitor speak, and timorously confess <END>
the manner and the purpose of his treason; <END>
that you might well have signified the same <END>
unto the citizens, who haply may <END>
misconstrue us in him and wail his death. <END>
but, my good lord, your grace's word shall serve, <END>
as well as i had seen and heard him speak <END>
and doubt you not, right noble princes both, <END>
but i'll acquaint our duteous citizens <END>
with all your just proceedings in this cause. <END>
and to that end we wish'd your lord-ship here, <END>
to avoid the carping censures of the world. <END>
but since you come too late of our intents, <END>
yet witness what you hear we did intend: <END>
and so, my good lord mayor, we bid farewell. <END>
go, after, after, cousin buckingham. <END>
the mayor towards guildhall hies him in all post: <END>
there, at your meet'st advantage of the time, <END>
infer the bastardy of edward's children: <END>
tell them how edward put to death a citizen, <END>
only for saying he would make his son <END>
heir to the crown; meaning indeed his house, <END>
which, by the sign thereof was termed so. <END>
moreover, urge his hateful luxury <END>
and bestial appetite in change of lust; <END>
which stretched to their servants, daughters, wives, <END>
even where his lustful eye or savage heart, <END>
without control, listed to make his prey. <END>
nay, for a need, thus far come near my person: <END>
tell them, when that my mother went with child <END>
of that unsatiate edward, noble york <END>
my princely father then had wars in france <END>
and, by just computation of the time, <END>
found that the issue was not his begot; <END>
which well appeared in his lineaments, <END>
being nothing like the noble duke my father: <END>
but touch this sparingly, as 'twere far off, <END>
because you know, my lord, my mother lives. <END>
fear not, my lord, i'll play the orator <END>
as if the golden fee for which i plead <END>
were for myself: and so, my lord, adieu. <END>
if you thrive well, bring them to baynard's castle; <END>
where you shall find me well accompanied <END>
with reverend fathers and well-learned bishops. <END>
i go: and towards three or four o'clock <END>
look for the news that the guildhall affords. <END>
go, lovel, with all speed to doctor shaw; <END>
go thou to friar penker; bid them both <END>
meet me within this hour at baynard's castle. <END>
now will i in, to take some privy order, <END>
to draw the brats of clarence out of sight; <END>
and to give notice, that no manner of person <END>
at any time have recourse unto the princes. <END>
this is the indictment of the good lord hastings; <END>
which in a set hand fairly is engross'd, <END>
that it may be this day read over in paul's. <END>
and mark how well the sequel hangs together: <END>
eleven hours i spent to write it over, <END>
for yesternight by catesby was it brought me; <END>
the precedent was full as long a-doing: <END>
and yet within these five hours lived lord hastings, <END>
untainted, unexamined, free, at liberty <END>
here's a good world the while! why who's so gross, <END>
that seeth not this palpable device? <END>
yet who's so blind, but says he sees it not? <END>
bad is the world; and all will come to nought, <END>
when such bad dealings must be seen in thought. <END>
how now, my lord, what say the citizens? <END>
now, by the holy mother of our lord, <END>
the citizens are mum and speak not a word. <END>
touch'd you the bastardy of edward's children? <END>
i did; with his contract with lady lucy, <END>
and his contract by deputy in france; <END>
the insatiate greediness of his desires, <END>
and his enforcement of the city wives; <END>
his tyranny for trifles; his own bastardy, <END>
as being got, your father then in france, <END>
his resemblance, being not like the duke; <END>
withal i did infer your lineaments, <END>
being the right idea of your father, <END>
both in your form and nobleness of mind; <END>
laid open all your victories in scotland, <END>
your dicipline in war, wisdom in peace, <END>
your bounty, virtue, fair humility: <END>
indeed, left nothing fitting for the purpose <END>
untouch'd, or slightly handled, in discourse <END>
and when mine oratory grew to an end <END>
i bid them that did love their country's good <END>
cry 'god save richard, england's royal king!' <END>
ah! and did they so? <END>
no, so god help me, they spake not a word; <END>
but, like dumb statues or breathing stones, <END>
gazed each on other, and look'd deadly pale. <END>
which when i saw, i reprehended them; <END>
and ask'd the mayor what meant this wilful silence: <END>
his answer was, the people were not wont <END>
to be spoke to but by the recorder. <END>
then he was urged to tell my tale again, <END>
'thus saith the duke, thus hath the duke inferr'd;' <END>
but nothing spake in warrant from himself. <END>
when he had done, some followers of mine own, <END>
at the lower end of the hall, hurl'd up their caps, <END>
and some ten voices cried 'god save king richard!' <END>
and thus i took the vantage of those few, <END>
'thanks, gentle citizens and friends,' quoth i; <END>
'this general applause and loving shout <END>
argues your wisdoms and your love to richard:' <END>
and even here brake off, and came away. <END>
what tongueless blocks were they! would not they speak? <END>
no, by my troth, my lord. <END>
will not the mayor then and his brethren come? <END>
the mayor is here at hand: intend some fear; <END>
be not you spoke with, but by mighty suit: <END>
and look you get a prayer-book in your hand, <END>
and stand betwixt two churchmen, good my lord; <END>
for on that ground i'll build a holy descant: <END>
and be not easily won to our request: <END>
play the maid's part, still answer nay, and take it. <END>
i go; and if you plead as well for them <END>
as i can say nay to thee for myself, <END>
no doubt well bring it to a happy issue. <END>
go, go, up to the leads; the lord mayor knocks. <END>
welcome my lord; i dance attendance here; <END>
i think the duke will not be spoke withal. <END>
here comes his servant: how now, catesby, <END>
what says he? <END>
my lord: he doth entreat your grace; <END>
to visit him to-morrow or next day: <END>
he is within, with two right reverend fathers, <END>
divinely bent to meditation; <END>
and no worldly suit would he be moved, <END>
to draw him from his holy exercise. <END>
return, good catesby, to thy lord again; <END>
tell him, myself, the mayor and citizens, <END>
in deep designs and matters of great moment, <END>
no less importing than our general good, <END>
are come to have some conference with his grace. <END>
i'll tell him what you say, my lord. <END>
ah, ha, my lord, this prince is not an edward! <END>
he is not lolling on a lewd day-bed, <END>
but on his knees at meditation; <END>
not dallying with a brace of courtezans, <END>
but meditating with two deep divines; <END>
not sleeping, to engross his idle body, <END>
but praying, to enrich his watchful soul: <END>
happy were england, would this gracious prince <END>
take on himself the sovereignty thereof: <END>
but, sure, i fear, we shall ne'er win him to it. <END>
marry, god forbid his grace should say us nay! <END>
i fear he will. <END>
how now, catesby, what says your lord? <END>
my lord, <END>
he wonders to what end you have assembled <END>
such troops of citizens to speak with him, <END>
his grace not being warn'd thereof before: <END>
my lord, he fears you mean no good to him. <END>
sorry i am my noble cousin should <END>
suspect me, that i mean no good to him: <END>
by heaven, i come in perfect love to him; <END>
and so once more return and tell his grace. <END>
when holy and devout religious men <END>
are at their beads, 'tis hard to draw them thence, <END>
so sweet is zealous contemplation. <END>
see, where he stands between two clergymen! <END>
two props of virtue for a christian prince, <END>
to stay him from the fall of vanity: <END>
and, see, a book of prayer in his hand, <END>
true ornaments to know a holy man. <END>
famous plantagenet, most gracious prince, <END>
lend favourable ears to our request; <END>
and pardon us the interruption <END>
of thy devotion and right christian zeal. <END>
my lord, there needs no such apology: <END>
i rather do beseech you pardon me, <END>
who, earnest in the service of my god, <END>
neglect the visitation of my friends. <END>
but, leaving this, what is your grace's pleasure? <END>
even that, i hope, which pleaseth god above, <END>
and all good men of this ungovern'd isle. <END>
i do suspect i have done some offence <END>
that seems disgracious in the city's eyes, <END>
and that you come to reprehend my ignorance. <END>
you have, my lord: would it might please your grace, <END>
at our entreaties, to amend that fault! <END>
else wherefore breathe i in a christian land? <END>
then know, it is your fault that you resign <END>
the supreme seat, the throne majestical, <END>
the scepter'd office of your ancestors, <END>
your state of fortune and your due of birth, <END>
the lineal glory of your royal house, <END>
to the corruption of a blemished stock: <END>
whilst, in the mildness of your sleepy thoughts, <END>
which here we waken to our country's good, <END>
this noble isle doth want her proper limbs; <END>
her face defaced with scars of infamy, <END>
her royal stock graft with ignoble plants, <END>
and almost shoulder'd in the swallowing gulf <END>
of blind forgetfulness and dark oblivion. <END>
which to recure, we heartily solicit <END>
your gracious self to take on you the charge <END>
and kingly government of this your land, <END>
not as protector, steward, substitute, <END>
or lowly factor for another's gain; <END>
but as successively from blood to blood, <END>
your right of birth, your empery, your own. <END>
for this, consorted with the citizens, <END>
your very worshipful and loving friends, <END>
and by their vehement instigation, <END>
in this just suit come i to move your grace. <END>
i know not whether to depart in silence, <END>
or bitterly to speak in your reproof. <END>
best fitteth my degree or your condition <END>
if not to answer, you might haply think <END>
tongue-tied ambition, not replying, yielded <END>
to bear the golden yoke of sovereignty, <END>
which fondly you would here impose on me; <END>
if to reprove you for this suit of yours, <END>
so season'd with your faithful love to me. <END>
then, on the other side, i cheque'd my friends. <END>
therefore, to speak, and to avoid the first, <END>
and then, in speaking, not to incur the last, <END>
definitively thus i answer you. <END>
your love deserves my thanks; but my desert <END>
unmeritable shuns your high request. <END>
first if all obstacles were cut away, <END>
and that my path were even to the crown, <END>
as my ripe revenue and due by birth <END>
yet so much is my poverty of spirit, <END>
so mighty and so many my defects, <END>
as i had rather hide me from my greatness, <END>
being a bark to brook no mighty sea, <END>
than in my greatness covet to be hid, <END>
and in the vapour of my glory smother'd. <END>
but, god be thank'd, there's no need of me, <END>
and much i need to help you, if need were; <END>
the royal tree hath left us royal fruit, <END>
which, mellow'd by the stealing hours of time, <END>
will well become the seat of majesty, <END>
and make, no doubt, us happy by his reign. <END>
on him i lay what you would lay on me, <END>
the right and fortune of his happy stars; <END>
which god defend that i should wring from him! <END>
my lord, this argues conscience in your grace; <END>
but the respects thereof are nice and trivial, <END>
all circumstances well considered. <END>
you say that edward is your brother's son: <END>
so say we too, but not by edward's wife; <END>
for first he was contract to lady lucy-- <END>
your mother lives a witness to that vow-- <END>
and afterward by substitute betroth'd <END>
to bona, sister to the king of france. <END>
these both put by a poor petitioner, <END>
a care-crazed mother of a many children, <END>
a beauty-waning and distressed widow, <END>
even in the afternoon of her best days, <END>
made prize and purchase of his lustful eye, <END>
seduced the pitch and height of all his thoughts <END>
to base declension and loathed bigamy <END>
by her, in his unlawful bed, he got <END>
this edward, whom our manners term the prince. <END>
more bitterly could i expostulate, <END>
save that, for reverence to some alive, <END>
i give a sparing limit to my tongue. <END>
then, good my lord, take to your royal self <END>
this proffer'd benefit of dignity; <END>
if non to bless us and the land withal, <END>
yet to draw forth your noble ancestry <END>
from the corruption of abusing times, <END>
unto a lineal true-derived course. <END>
do, good my lord, your citizens entreat you. <END>
refuse not, mighty lord, this proffer'd love. <END>
o, make them joyful, grant their lawful suit! <END>
alas, why would you heap these cares on me? <END>
i am unfit for state and majesty; <END>
i do beseech you, take it not amiss; <END>
i cannot nor i will not yield to you. <END>
if you refuse it,--as, in love and zeal, <END>
loath to depose the child, your brother's son; <END>
as well we know your tenderness of heart <END>
and gentle, kind, effeminate remorse, <END>
which we have noted in you to your kin, <END>
and egally indeed to all estates,-- <END>
yet whether you accept our suit or no, <END>
your brother's son shall never reign our king; <END>
but we will plant some other in the throne, <END>
to the disgrace and downfall of your house: <END>
and in this resolution here we leave you.-- <END>
come, citizens: 'zounds! i'll entreat no more. <END>
o, do not swear, my lord of buckingham. <END>
call them again, my lord, and accept their suit. <END>
do, good my lord, lest all the land do rue it. <END>
would you enforce me to a world of care? <END>
well, call them again. i am not made of stone, <END>
but penetrable to your. kind entreats, <END>
albeit against my conscience and my soul. <END>
cousin of buckingham, and you sage, grave men, <END>
since you will buckle fortune on my back, <END>
to bear her burthen, whether i will or no, <END>
i must have patience to endure the load: <END>
but if black scandal or foul-faced reproach <END>
attend the sequel of your imposition, <END>
your mere enforcement shall acquittance me <END>
from all the impure blots and stains thereof; <END>
for god he knows, and you may partly see, <END>
how far i am from the desire thereof. <END>
god bless your grace! we see it, and will say it. <END>
in saying so, you shall but say the truth. <END>
then i salute you with this kingly title: <END>
long live richard, england's royal king! <END>
amen. <END>
to-morrow will it please you to be crown'd? <END>
even when you please, since you will have it so. <END>
to-morrow, then, we will attend your grace: <END>
and so most joyfully we take our leave. <END>
come, let us to our holy task again. <END>
farewell, good cousin; farewell, gentle friends. <END>
who meets us here?  my niece plantagenet <END>
led in the hand of her kind aunt of gloucester? <END>
now, for my life, she's wandering to the tower, <END>
on pure heart's love to greet the tender princes. <END>
daughter, well met. <END>
god give your graces both <END>
a happy and a joyful time of day! <END>
as much to you, good sister! whither away? <END>
no farther than the tower; and, as i guess, <END>
upon the like devotion as yourselves, <END>
to gratulate the gentle princes there. <END>
kind sister, thanks: we'll enter all together. <END>
and, in good time, here the lieutenant comes. <END>
master lieutenant, pray you, by your leave, <END>
how doth the prince, and my young son of york? <END>
right well, dear madam. by your patience, <END>
i may not suffer you to visit them; <END>
the king hath straitly charged the contrary. <END>
the king! why, who's that? <END>
i cry you mercy: i mean the lord protector. <END>
the lord protect him from that kingly title! <END>
hath he set bounds betwixt their love and me? <END>
i am their mother; who should keep me from them? <END>
i am their fathers mother; i will see them. <END>
their aunt i am in law, in love their mother: <END>
then bring me to their sights; i'll bear thy blame <END>
and take thy office from thee, on my peril. <END>
no, madam, no; i may not leave it so: <END>
i am bound by oath, and therefore pardon me. <END>
let me but meet you, ladies, one hour hence, <END>
and i'll salute your grace of york as mother, <END>
and reverend looker on, of two fair queens. <END>
come, madam, you must straight to westminster, <END>
there to be crowned richard's royal queen. <END>
o, cut my lace in sunder, that my pent heart <END>
may have some scope to beat, or else i swoon <END>
with this dead-killing news! <END>
despiteful tidings! o unpleasing news! <END>
be of good cheer: mother, how fares your grace? <END>
o dorset, speak not to me, get thee hence! <END>
death and destruction dog thee at the heels; <END>
thy mother's name is ominous to children. <END>
if thou wilt outstrip death, go cross the seas, <END>
and live with richmond, from the reach of hell <END>
go, hie thee, hie thee from this slaughter-house, <END>
lest thou increase the number of the dead; <END>
and make me die the thrall of margaret's curse, <END>
nor mother, wife, nor england's counted queen. <END>
full of wise care is this your counsel, madam. <END>
take all the swift advantage of the hours; <END>
you shall have letters from me to my son <END>
to meet you on the way, and welcome you. <END>
be not ta'en tardy by unwise delay. <END>
o ill-dispersing wind of misery! <END>
o my accursed womb, the bed of death! <END>
a cockatrice hast thou hatch'd to the world, <END>
whose unavoided eye is murderous. <END>
come, madam, come; i in all haste was sent. <END>
and i in all unwillingness will go. <END>
i would to god that the inclusive verge <END>
of golden metal that must round my brow <END>
were red-hot steel, to sear me to the brain! <END>
anointed let me be with deadly venom, <END>
and die, ere men can say, god save the queen! <END>
go, go, poor soul, i envy not thy glory <END>
to feed my humour, wish thyself no harm. <END>
no! why?  when he that is my husband now <END>
came to me, as i follow'd henry's corse, <END>
when scarce the blood was well wash'd from his hands <END>
which issued from my other angel husband <END>
and that dead saint which then i weeping follow'd; <END>
o, when, i say, i look'd on richard's face, <END>
this was my wish: 'be thou,' quoth i, ' accursed, <END>
for making me, so young, so old a widow! <END>
and, when thou wed'st, let sorrow haunt thy bed; <END>
and be thy wife--if any be so mad-- <END>
as miserable by the life of thee <END>
as thou hast made me by my dear lord's death! <END>
lo, ere i can repeat this curse again, <END>
even in so short a space, my woman's heart <END>
grossly grew captive to his honey words <END>
and proved the subject of my own soul's curse, <END>
which ever since hath kept my eyes from rest; <END>
for never yet one hour in his bed <END>
have i enjoy'd the golden dew of sleep, <END>
but have been waked by his timorous dreams. <END>
besides, he hates me for my father warwick; <END>
and will, no doubt, shortly be rid of me. <END>
poor heart, adieu! i pity thy complaining. <END>
no more than from my soul i mourn for yours. <END>
farewell, thou woful welcomer of glory! <END>
adieu, poor soul, that takest thy leave of it! <END>
stay, yet look back with me unto the tower. <END>
pity, you ancient stones, those tender babes <END>
whom envy hath immured within your walls! <END>
rough cradle for such little pretty ones! <END>
rude ragged nurse, old sullen playfellow <END>
for tender princes, use my babies well! <END>
so foolish sorrow bids your stones farewell. <END>
stand all apart cousin of buckingham! <END>
my gracious sovereign? <END>
give me thy hand. <END>
thus high, by thy advice <END>
and thy assistance, is king richard seated; <END>
but shall we wear these honours for a day? <END>
or shall they last, and we rejoice in them? <END>
still live they and for ever may they last! <END>
o buckingham, now do i play the touch, <END>
to try if thou be current gold indeed <END>
young edward lives: think now what i would say. <END>
say on, my loving lord. <END>
why, buckingham, i say, i would be king, <END>
why, so you are, my thrice renowned liege. <END>
ha! am i king? 'tis so: but edward lives. <END>
true, noble prince. <END>
o bitter consequence, <END>
that edward still should live! 'true, noble prince!' <END>
cousin, thou wert not wont to be so dull: <END>
shall i be plain? i wish the bastards dead; <END>
and i would have it suddenly perform'd. <END>
what sayest thou? speak suddenly; be brief. <END>
your grace may do your pleasure. <END>
tut, tut, thou art all ice, thy kindness freezeth: <END>
say, have i thy consent that they shall die? <END>
give me some breath, some little pause, my lord <END>
before i positively herein: <END>
i will resolve your grace immediately. <END>
i will converse with iron-witted fools <END>
and unrespective boys: none are for me <END>
that look into me with considerate eyes: <END>
high-reaching buckingham grows circumspect. <END>
boy! <END>
my lord? <END>
know'st thou not any whom corrupting gold <END>
would tempt unto a close exploit of death? <END>
my lord, i know a discontented gentleman, <END>
whose humble means match not his haughty mind: <END>
gold were as good as twenty orators, <END>
and will, no doubt, tempt him to any thing. <END>
what is his name? <END>
his name, my lord, is tyrrel. <END>
i partly know the man: go, call him hither. <END>
the deep-revolving witty buckingham <END>
no more shall be the neighbour to my counsel: <END>
hath he so long held out with me untired, <END>
and stops he now for breath? <END>
how now! what news with you? <END>
my lord, i hear the marquis dorset's fled <END>
to richmond, in those parts beyond the sea <END>
where he abides. <END>
catesby! <END>
my lord? <END>
rumour it abroad <END>
that anne, my wife, is sick and like to die: <END>
i will take order for her keeping close. <END>
inquire me out some mean-born gentleman, <END>
whom i will marry straight to clarence' daughter: <END>
the boy is foolish, and i fear not him. <END>
look, how thou dream'st! i say again, give out <END>
that anne my wife is sick and like to die: <END>
about it; for it stands me much upon, <END>
to stop all hopes whose growth may damage me. <END>
i must be married to my brother's daughter, <END>
or else my kingdom stands on brittle glass. <END>
murder her brothers, and then marry her! <END>
uncertain way of gain! but i am in <END>
so far in blood that sin will pluck on sin: <END>
tear-falling pity dwells not in this eye. <END>
is thy name tyrrel? <END>
james tyrrel, and your most obedient subject. <END>
art thou, indeed? <END>
prove me, my gracious sovereign. <END>
darest thou resolve to kill a friend of mine? <END>
ay, my lord; <END>
but i had rather kill two enemies. <END>
why, there thou hast it: two deep enemies, <END>
foes to my rest and my sweet sleep's disturbers <END>
are they that i would have thee deal upon: <END>
tyrrel, i mean those bastards in the tower. <END>
let me have open means to come to them, <END>
and soon i'll rid you from the fear of them. <END>
thou sing'st sweet music. hark, come hither, tyrrel <END>
go, by this token: rise, and lend thine ear: <END>
there is no more but so: say it is done, <END>
and i will love thee, and prefer thee too. <END>
'tis done, my gracious lord. <END>
shall we hear from thee, tyrrel, ere we sleep? <END>
ye shall, my lord. <END>
my lord, i have consider'd in my mind <END>
the late demand that you did sound me in. <END>
well, let that pass. dorset is fled to richmond. <END>
i hear that news, my lord. <END>
stanley, he is your wife's son well, look to it. <END>
my lord, i claim your gift, my due by promise, <END>
for which your honour and your faith is pawn'd; <END>
the earldom of hereford and the moveables <END>
the which you promised i should possess. <END>
stanley, look to your wife; if she convey <END>
letters to richmond, you shall answer it. <END>
what says your highness to my just demand? <END>
as i remember, henry the sixth <END>
did prophesy that richmond should be king, <END>
when richmond was a little peevish boy. <END>
a king, perhaps, perhaps,-- <END>
my lord! <END>
how chance the prophet could not at that time <END>
have told me, i being by, that i should kill him? <END>
my lord, your promise for the earldom,-- <END>
richmond! when last i was at exeter, <END>
the mayor in courtesy show'd me the castle, <END>
and call'd it rougemont: at which name i started, <END>
because a bard of ireland told me once <END>
i should not live long after i saw richmond. <END>
my lord! <END>
ay, what's o'clock? <END>
i am thus bold to put your grace in mind <END>
of what you promised me. <END>
well, but what's o'clock? <END>
upon the stroke of ten. <END>
well, let it strike. <END>
why let it strike? <END>
because that, like a jack, thou keep'st the stroke <END>
betwixt thy begging and my meditation. <END>
i am not in the giving vein to-day. <END>
why, then resolve me whether you will or no. <END>
tut, tut, <END>
thou troublest me; am not in the vein. <END>
is it even so? rewards he my true service <END>
with such deep contempt made i him king for this? <END>
o, let me think on hastings, and be gone <END>
to brecknock, while my fearful head is on! <END>
the tyrannous and bloody deed is done. <END>
the most arch of piteous massacre <END>
that ever yet this land was guilty of. <END>
dighton and forrest, whom i did suborn <END>
to do this ruthless piece of butchery, <END>
although they were flesh'd villains, bloody dogs, <END>
melting with tenderness and kind compassion <END>
wept like two children in their deaths' sad stories. <END>
'lo, thus' quoth dighton, 'lay those tender babes:' <END>
'thus, thus,' quoth forrest, 'girdling one another <END>
within their innocent alabaster arms: <END>
their lips were four red roses on a stalk, <END>
which in their summer beauty kiss'd each other. <END>
a book of prayers on their pillow lay; <END>
which once,' quoth forrest, 'almost changed my mind; <END>
but o! the devil'--there the villain stopp'd <END>
whilst dighton thus told on: 'we smothered <END>
the most replenished sweet work of nature, <END>
that from the prime creation e'er she framed.' <END>
thus both are gone with conscience and remorse; <END>
they could not speak; and so i left them both, <END>
to bring this tidings to the bloody king. <END>
and here he comes. <END>
all hail, my sovereign liege! <END>
kind tyrrel, am i happy in thy news? <END>
if to have done the thing you gave in charge <END>
beget your happiness, be happy then, <END>
for it is done, my lord. <END>
but didst thou see them dead? <END>
i did, my lord. <END>
and buried, gentle tyrrel? <END>
the chaplain of the tower hath buried them; <END>
but how or in what place i do not know. <END>
come to me, tyrrel, soon at after supper, <END>
and thou shalt tell the process of their death. <END>
meantime, but think how i may do thee good, <END>
and be inheritor of thy desire. <END>
farewell till soon. <END>
the son of clarence have i pent up close; <END>
his daughter meanly have i match'd in marriage; <END>
the sons of edward sleep in abraham's bosom, <END>
and anne my wife hath bid the world good night. <END>
now, for i know the breton richmond aims <END>
at young elizabeth, my brother's daughter, <END>
and, by that knot, looks proudly o'er the crown, <END>
to her i go, a jolly thriving wooer. <END>
my lord! <END>
good news or bad, that thou comest in so bluntly? <END>
bad news, my lord: ely is fled to richmond; <END>
and buckingham, back'd with the hardy welshmen, <END>
is in the field, and still his power increaseth. <END>
ely with richmond troubles me more near <END>
than buckingham and his rash-levied army. <END>
come, i have heard that fearful commenting <END>
is leaden servitor to dull delay; <END>
delay leads impotent and snail-paced beggary <END>
then fiery expedition be my wing, <END>
jove's mercury, and herald for a king! <END>
come, muster men: my counsel is my shield; <END>
we must be brief when traitors brave the field. <END>
so, now prosperity begins to mellow <END>
and drop into the rotten mouth of death. <END>
here in these confines slily have i lurk'd, <END>
to watch the waning of mine adversaries. <END>
a dire induction am i witness to, <END>
and will to france, hoping the consequence <END>
will prove as bitter, black, and tragical. <END>
withdraw thee, wretched margaret: who comes here? <END>
ah, my young princes! ah, my tender babes! <END>
my unblown flowers, new-appearing sweets! <END>
if yet your gentle souls fly in the air <END>
and be not fix'd in doom perpetual, <END>
hover about me with your airy wings <END>
and hear your mother's lamentation! <END>
hover about her; say, that right for right <END>
hath dimm'd your infant morn to aged night. <END>
so many miseries have crazed my voice, <END>
that my woe-wearied tongue is mute and dumb, <END>
edward plantagenet, why art thou dead? <END>
plantagenet doth quit plantagenet. <END>
edward for edward pays a dying debt. <END>
wilt thou, o god, fly from such gentle lambs, <END>
and throw them in the entrails of the wolf? <END>
when didst thou sleep when such a deed was done? <END>
when holy harry died, and my sweet son. <END>
blind sight, dead life, poor mortal living ghost, <END>
woe's scene, world's shame, grave's due by life usurp'd, <END>
brief abstract and record of tedious days, <END>
rest thy unrest on england's lawful earth, <END>
unlawfully made drunk with innocents' blood! <END>
o, that thou wouldst as well afford a grave <END>
as thou canst yield a melancholy seat! <END>
then would i hide my bones, not rest them here. <END>
o, who hath any cause to mourn but i? <END>
if ancient sorrow be most reverend, <END>
give mine the benefit of seniory, <END>
and let my woes frown on the upper hand. <END>
if sorrow can admit society, <END>
tell o'er your woes again by viewing mine: <END>
i had an edward, till a richard kill'd him; <END>
i had a harry, till a richard kill'd him: <END>
thou hadst an edward, till a richard kill'd him; <END>
thou hadst a richard, till a richard killed him; <END>
i had a richard too, and thou didst kill him; <END>
i had a rutland too, thou holp'st to kill him. <END>
thou hadst a clarence too, and richard kill'd him. <END>
from forth the kennel of thy womb hath crept <END>
a hell-hound that doth hunt us all to death: <END>
that dog, that had his teeth before his eyes, <END>
to worry lambs and lap their gentle blood, <END>
that foul defacer of god's handiwork, <END>
that excellent grand tyrant of the earth, <END>
that reigns in galled eyes of weeping souls, <END>
thy womb let loose, to chase us to our graves. <END>
o upright, just, and true-disposing god, <END>
how do i thank thee, that this carnal cur <END>
preys on the issue of his mother's body, <END>
and makes her pew-fellow with others' moan! <END>
o harry's wife, triumph not in my woes! <END>
god witness with me, i have wept for thine. <END>
bear with me; i am hungry for revenge, <END>
and now i cloy me with beholding it. <END>
thy edward he is dead, that stabb'd my edward: <END>
thy other edward dead, to quit my edward; <END>
young york he is but boot, because both they <END>
match not the high perfection of my loss: <END>
thy clarence he is dead that kill'd my edward; <END>
and the beholders of this tragic play, <END>
the adulterate hastings, rivers, vaughan, grey, <END>
untimely smother'd in their dusky graves. <END>
richard yet lives, hell's black intelligencer, <END>
only reserved their factor, to buy souls <END>
and send them thither: but at hand, at hand, <END>
ensues his piteous and unpitied end: <END>
earth gapes, hell burns, fiends roar, saints pray. <END>
to have him suddenly convey'd away. <END>
cancel his bond of life, dear god, i prey, <END>
that i may live to say, the dog is dead! <END>
o, thou didst prophesy the time would come <END>
that i should wish for thee to help me curse <END>
that bottled spider, that foul bunch-back'd toad! <END>
i call'd thee then vain flourish of my fortune; <END>
i call'd thee then poor shadow, painted queen; <END>
the presentation of but what i was; <END>
the flattering index of a direful pageant; <END>
one heaved a-high, to be hurl'd down below; <END>
a mother only mock'd with two sweet babes; <END>
a dream of what thou wert, a breath, a bubble, <END>
a sign of dignity, a garish flag, <END>
to be the aim of every dangerous shot, <END>
a queen in jest, only to fill the scene. <END>
where is thy husband now? where be thy brothers? <END>
where are thy children? wherein dost thou, joy? <END>
who sues to thee and cries 'god save the queen'? <END>
where be the bending peers that flatter'd thee? <END>
where be the thronging troops that follow'd thee? <END>
decline all this, and see what now thou art: <END>
for happy wife, a most distressed widow; <END>
for joyful mother, one that wails the name; <END>
for queen, a very caitiff crown'd with care; <END>
for one being sued to, one that humbly sues; <END>
for one that scorn'd at me, now scorn'd of me; <END>
for one being fear'd of all, now fearing one; <END>
for one commanding all, obey'd of none. <END>
thus hath the course of justice wheel'd about, <END>
and left thee but a very prey to time; <END>
having no more but thought of what thou wert, <END>
to torture thee the more, being what thou art. <END>
thou didst usurp my place, and dost thou not <END>
usurp the just proportion of my sorrow? <END>
now thy proud neck bears half my burthen'd yoke; <END>
from which even here i slip my weary neck, <END>
and leave the burthen of it all on thee. <END>
farewell, york's wife, and queen of sad mischance: <END>
these english woes will make me smile in france. <END>
o thou well skill'd in curses, stay awhile, <END>
and teach me how to curse mine enemies! <END>
forbear to sleep the nights, and fast the days; <END>
compare dead happiness with living woe; <END>
think that thy babes were fairer than they were, <END>
and he that slew them fouler than he is: <END>
bettering thy loss makes the bad causer worse: <END>
revolving this will teach thee how to curse. <END>
my words are dull; o, quicken them with thine! <END>
thy woes will make them sharp, and pierce like mine. <END>
why should calamity be full of words? <END>
windy attorneys to their client woes, <END>
airy succeeders of intestate joys, <END>
poor breathing orators of miseries! <END>
let them have scope: though what they do impart <END>
help not all, yet do they ease the heart. <END>
if so, then be not tongue-tied: go with me. <END>
and in the breath of bitter words let's smother <END>
my damned son, which thy two sweet sons smother'd. <END>
i hear his drum: be copious in exclaims. <END>
who intercepts my expedition? <END>
o, she that might have intercepted thee, <END>
by strangling thee in her accursed womb <END>
from all the slaughters, wretch, that thou hast done! <END>
hidest thou that forehead with a golden crown, <END>
where should be graven, if that right were right, <END>
the slaughter of the prince that owed that crown, <END>
and the dire death of my two sons and brothers? <END>
tell me, thou villain slave, where are my children? <END>
thou toad, thou toad, where is thy brother clarence? <END>
and little ned plantagenet, his son? <END>
where is kind hastings, rivers, vaughan, grey? <END>
a flourish, trumpets! strike alarum, drums! <END>
let not the heavens hear these tell-tale women <END>
rail on the lord's enointed: strike, i say! <END>
either be patient, and entreat me fair, <END>
or with the clamorous report of war <END>
thus will i drown your exclamations. <END>
art thou my son? <END>
ay, i thank god, my father, and yourself. <END>
then patiently hear my impatience. <END>
madam, i have a touch of your condition, <END>
which cannot brook the accent of reproof. <END>
o, let me speak! <END>
do then: but i'll not hear. <END>
i will be mild and gentle in my speech. <END>
and brief, good mother; for i am in haste. <END>
art thou so hasty? i have stay'd for thee, <END>
god knows, in anguish, pain and agony. <END>
and came i not at last to comfort you? <END>
no, by the holy rood, thou know'st it well, <END>
thou camest on earth to make the earth my hell. <END>
a grievous burthen was thy birth to me; <END>
tetchy and wayward was thy infancy; <END>
thy school-days frightful, desperate, wild, and furious, <END>
thy prime of manhood daring, bold, and venturous, <END>
thy age confirm'd, proud, subdued, bloody, <END>
treacherous, <END>
more mild, but yet more harmful, kind in hatred: <END>
what comfortable hour canst thou name, <END>
that ever graced me in thy company? <END>
faith, none, but humphrey hour, that call'd <END>
your grace <END>
to breakfast once forth of my company. <END>
if i be so disgracious in your sight, <END>
let me march on, and not offend your grace. <END>
strike the drum. <END>
i prithee, hear me speak. <END>
you speak too bitterly. <END>
hear me a word; <END>
for i shall never speak to thee again. <END>
so. <END>
either thou wilt die, by god's just ordinance, <END>
ere from this war thou turn a conqueror, <END>
or i with grief and extreme age shall perish <END>
and never look upon thy face again. <END>
therefore take with thee my most heavy curse; <END>
which, in the day of battle, tire thee more <END>
than all the complete armour that thou wear'st! <END>
my prayers on the adverse party fight; <END>
and there the little souls of edward's children <END>
whisper the spirits of thine enemies <END>
and promise them success and victory. <END>
bloody thou art, bloody will be thy end; <END>
shame serves thy life and doth thy death attend. <END>
though far more cause, yet much less spirit to curse <END>
abides in me; i say amen to all. <END>
stay, madam; i must speak a word with you. <END>
i have no more sons of the royal blood <END>
for thee to murder: for my daughters, richard, <END>
they shall be praying nuns, not weeping queens; <END>
and therefore level not to hit their lives. <END>
you have a daughter call'd elizabeth, <END>
virtuous and fair, royal and gracious. <END>
and must she die for this? o, let her live, <END>
and i'll corrupt her manners, stain her beauty; <END>
slander myself as false to edward's bed; <END>
throw over her the veil of infamy: <END>
so she may live unscarr'd of bleeding slaughter, <END>
i will confess she was not edward's daughter. <END>
wrong not her birth, she is of royal blood. <END>
to save her life, i'll say she is not so. <END>
her life is only safest in her birth. <END>
and only in that safety died her brothers. <END>
lo, at their births good stars were opposite. <END>
no, to their lives bad friends were contrary. <END>
all unavoided is the doom of destiny. <END>
true, when avoided grace makes destiny: <END>
my babes were destined to a fairer death, <END>
if grace had bless'd thee with a fairer life. <END>
you speak as if that i had slain my cousins. <END>
cousins, indeed; and by their uncle cozen'd <END>
of comfort, kingdom, kindred, freedom, life. <END>
whose hand soever lanced their tender hearts, <END>
thy head, all indirectly, gave direction: <END>
no doubt the murderous knife was dull and blunt <END>
till it was whetted on thy stone-hard heart, <END>
to revel in the entrails of my lambs. <END>
but that still use of grief makes wild grief tame, <END>
my tongue should to thy ears not name my boys <END>
till that my nails were anchor'd in thine eyes; <END>
and i, in such a desperate bay of death, <END>
like a poor bark, of sails and tackling reft, <END>
rush all to pieces on thy rocky bosom. <END>
madam, so thrive i in my enterprise <END>
and dangerous success of bloody wars, <END>
as i intend more good to you and yours, <END>
than ever you or yours were by me wrong'd! <END>
what good is cover'd with the face of heaven, <END>
to be discover'd, that can do me good? <END>
the advancement of your children, gentle lady. <END>
up to some scaffold, there to lose their heads? <END>
no, to the dignity and height of honour <END>
the high imperial type of this earth's glory. <END>
flatter my sorrows with report of it; <END>
tell me what state, what dignity, what honour, <END>
canst thou demise to any child of mine? <END>
even all i have; yea, and myself and all, <END>
will i withal endow a child of thine; <END>
so in the lethe of thy angry soul <END>
thou drown the sad remembrance of those wrongs <END>
which thou supposest i have done to thee. <END>
be brief, lest that be process of thy kindness <END>
last longer telling than thy kindness' date. <END>
then know, that from my soul i love thy daughter. <END>
my daughter's mother thinks it with her soul. <END>
what do you think? <END>
that thou dost love my daughter from thy soul: <END>
so from thy soul's love didst thou love her brothers; <END>
and from my heart's love i do thank thee for it. <END>
be not so hasty to confound my meaning: <END>
i mean, that with my soul i love thy daughter, <END>
and mean to make her queen of england. <END>
say then, who dost thou mean shall be her king? <END>
even he that makes her queen who should be else? <END>
what, thou? <END>
i, even i: what think you of it, madam? <END>
how canst thou woo her? <END>
that would i learn of you, <END>
as one that are best acquainted with her humour. <END>
and wilt thou learn of me? <END>
madam, with all my heart. <END>
send to her, by the man that slew her brothers, <END>
a pair of bleeding-hearts; thereon engrave <END>
edward and york; then haply she will weep: <END>
therefore present to her--as sometime margaret <END>
did to thy father, steep'd in rutland's blood,-- <END>
a handkerchief; which, say to her, did drain <END>
the purple sap from her sweet brother's body <END>
and bid her dry her weeping eyes therewith. <END>
if this inducement force her not to love, <END>
send her a story of thy noble acts; <END>
tell her thou madest away her uncle clarence, <END>
her uncle rivers; yea, and, for her sake, <END>
madest quick conveyance with her good aunt anne. <END>
come, come, you mock me; this is not the way <END>
to win our daughter. <END>
there is no other way <END>
unless thou couldst put on some other shape, <END>
and not be richard that hath done all this. <END>
say that i did all this for love of her. <END>
nay, then indeed she cannot choose but hate thee, <END>
having bought love with such a bloody spoil. <END>
look, what is done cannot be now amended: <END>
men shall deal unadvisedly sometimes, <END>
which after hours give leisure to repent. <END>
if i did take the kingdom from your sons, <END>
to make amends, ill give it to your daughter. <END>
if i have kill'd the issue of your womb, <END>
to quicken your increase, i will beget <END>
mine issue of your blood upon your daughter <END>
a grandam's name is little less in love <END>
than is the doting title of a mother; <END>
they are as children but one step below, <END>
even of your mettle, of your very blood; <END>
of an one pain, save for a night of groans <END>
endured of her, for whom you bid like sorrow. <END>
your children were vexation to your youth, <END>
but mine shall be a comfort to your age. <END>
the loss you have is but a son being king, <END>
and by that loss your daughter is made queen. <END>
i cannot make you what amends i would, <END>
therefore accept such kindness as i can. <END>
dorset your son, that with a fearful soul <END>
leads discontented steps in foreign soil, <END>
this fair alliance quickly shall call home <END>
to high promotions and great dignity: <END>
the king, that calls your beauteous daughter wife. <END>
familiarly shall call thy dorset brother; <END>
again shall you be mother to a king, <END>
and all the ruins of distressful times <END>
repair'd with double riches of content. <END>
what! we have many goodly days to see: <END>
the liquid drops of tears that you have shed <END>
shall come again, transform'd to orient pearl, <END>
advantaging their loan with interest <END>
of ten times double gain of happiness. <END>
go, then my mother, to thy daughter go <END>
make bold her bashful years with your experience; <END>
prepare her ears to hear a wooer's tale <END>
put in her tender heart the aspiring flame <END>
of golden sovereignty; acquaint the princess <END>
with the sweet silent hours of marriage joys <END>
and when this arm of mine hath chastised <END>
the petty rebel, dull-brain'd buckingham, <END>
bound with triumphant garlands will i come <END>
and lead thy daughter to a conqueror's bed; <END>
to whom i will retail my conquest won, <END>
and she shall be sole victress, caesar's caesar. <END>
what were i best to say? her father's brother <END>
would be her lord? or shall i say, her uncle? <END>
or, he that slew her brothers and her uncles? <END>
under what title shall i woo for thee, <END>
that god, the law, my honour and her love, <END>
can make seem pleasing to her tender years? <END>
infer fair england's peace by this alliance. <END>
which she shall purchase with still lasting war. <END>
say that the king, which may command, entreats. <END>
that at her hands which the king's king forbids. <END>
say, she shall be a high and mighty queen. <END>
to wail the tide, as her mother doth. <END>
say, i will love her everlastingly. <END>
but how long shall that title 'ever' last? <END>
sweetly in force unto her fair life's end. <END>
but how long fairly shall her sweet lie last? <END>
so long as heaven and nature lengthens it. <END>
so long as hell and richard likes of it. <END>
say, i, her sovereign, am her subject love. <END>
but she, your subject, loathes such sovereignty. <END>
be eloquent in my behalf to her. <END>
an honest tale speeds best being plainly told. <END>
then in plain terms tell her my loving tale. <END>
plain and not honest is too harsh a style. <END>
your reasons are too shallow and too quick. <END>
o no, my reasons are too deep and dead; <END>
too deep and dead, poor infants, in their grave. <END>
harp not on that string, madam; that is past. <END>
harp on it still shall i till heart-strings break. <END>
now, by my george, my garter, and my crown,-- <END>
profaned, dishonour'd, and the third usurp'd. <END>
i swear-- <END>
by nothing; for this is no oath: <END>
the george, profaned, hath lost his holy honour; <END>
the garter, blemish'd, pawn'd his knightly virtue; <END>
the crown, usurp'd, disgraced his kingly glory. <END>
if something thou wilt swear to be believed, <END>
swear then by something that thou hast not wrong'd. <END>
now, by the world-- <END>
'tis full of thy foul wrongs. <END>
my father's death-- <END>
thy life hath that dishonour'd. <END>
then, by myself-- <END>
thyself thyself misusest. <END>
why then, by god-- <END>
god's wrong is most of all. <END>
if thou hadst fear'd to break an oath by him, <END>
the unity the king thy brother made <END>
had not been broken, nor my brother slain: <END>
if thou hadst fear'd to break an oath by him, <END>
the imperial metal, circling now thy brow, <END>
had graced the tender temples of my child, <END>
and both the princes had been breathing here, <END>
which now, two tender playfellows to dust, <END>
thy broken faith hath made a prey for worms. <END>
what canst thou swear by now? <END>
the time to come. <END>
that thou hast wronged in the time o'erpast; <END>
for i myself have many tears to wash <END>
hereafter time, for time past wrong'd by thee. <END>
the children live, whose parents thou hast <END>
slaughter'd, <END>
ungovern'd youth, to wail it in their age; <END>
the parents live, whose children thou hast butcher'd, <END>
old wither'd plants, to wail it with their age. <END>
swear not by time to come; for that thou hast <END>
misused ere used, by time misused o'erpast. <END>
as i intend to prosper and repent, <END>
so thrive i in my dangerous attempt <END>
of hostile arms! myself myself confound! <END>
heaven and fortune bar me happy hours! <END>
day, yield me not thy light; nor, night, thy rest! <END>
be opposite all planets of good luck <END>
to my proceedings, if, with pure heart's love, <END>
immaculate devotion, holy thoughts, <END>
i tender not thy beauteous princely daughter! <END>
in her consists my happiness and thine; <END>
without her, follows to this land and me, <END>
to thee, herself, and many a christian soul, <END>
death, desolation, ruin and decay: <END>
it cannot be avoided but by this; <END>
it will not be avoided but by this. <END>
therefore, good mother,--i must can you so-- <END>
be the attorney of my love to her: <END>
plead what i will be, not what i have been; <END>
not my deserts, but what i will deserve: <END>
urge the necessity and state of times, <END>
and be not peevish-fond in great designs. <END>
shall i be tempted of the devil thus? <END>
ay, if the devil tempt thee to do good. <END>
shall i forget myself to be myself? <END>
ay, if yourself's remembrance wrong yourself. <END>
but thou didst kill my children. <END>
but in your daughter's womb i bury them: <END>
where in that nest of spicery they shall breed <END>
selves of themselves, to your recomforture. <END>
shall i go win my daughter to thy will? <END>
and be a happy mother by the deed. <END>
i go. write to me very shortly. <END>
and you shall understand from me her mind. <END>
bear her my true love's kiss; and so, farewell. <END>
relenting fool, and shallow, changing woman! <END>
how now! what news? <END>
my gracious sovereign, on the western coast <END>
rideth a puissant navy; to the shore <END>
throng many doubtful hollow-hearted friends, <END>
unarm'd, and unresolved to beat them back: <END>
'tis thought that richmond is their admiral; <END>
and there they hull, expecting but the aid <END>
of buckingham to welcome them ashore. <END>
some light-foot friend post to the duke of norfolk: <END>
ratcliff, thyself, or catesby; where is he? <END>
here, my lord. <END>
fly to the duke: <END>
post thou to salisbury <END>
when thou comest thither-- <END>
dull, unmindful villain, <END>
why stand'st thou still, and go'st not to the duke? <END>
first, mighty sovereign, let me know your mind, <END>
what from your grace i shall deliver to him. <END>
o, true, good catesby: bid him levy straight <END>
the greatest strength and power he can make, <END>
and meet me presently at salisbury. <END>
i go. <END>
what is't your highness' pleasure i shall do at <END>
salisbury? <END>
why, what wouldst thou do there before i go? <END>
your highness told me i should post before. <END>
my mind is changed, sir, my mind is changed. <END>
how now, what news with you? <END>
none good, my lord, to please you with the hearing; <END>
nor none so bad, but it may well be told. <END>
hoyday, a riddle! neither good nor bad! <END>
why dost thou run so many mile about, <END>
when thou mayst tell thy tale a nearer way? <END>
once more, what news? <END>
richmond is on the seas. <END>
there let him sink, and be the seas on him! <END>
white-liver'd runagate, what doth he there? <END>
i know not, mighty sovereign, but by guess. <END>
well, sir, as you guess, as you guess? <END>
stirr'd up by dorset, buckingham, and ely, <END>
he makes for england, there to claim the crown. <END>
is the chair empty? is the sword unsway'd? <END>
is the king dead? the empire unpossess'd? <END>
what heir of york is there alive but we? <END>
and who is england's king but great york's heir? <END>
then, tell me, what doth he upon the sea? <END>
unless for that, my liege, i cannot guess. <END>
unless for that he comes to be your liege, <END>
you cannot guess wherefore the welshman comes. <END>
thou wilt revolt, and fly to him, i fear. <END>
no, mighty liege; therefore mistrust me not. <END>
where is thy power, then, to beat him back? <END>
where are thy tenants and thy followers? <END>
are they not now upon the western shore. <END>
safe-conducting the rebels from their ships! <END>
no, my good lord, my friends are in the north. <END>
cold friends to richard: what do they in the north, <END>
when they should serve their sovereign in the west? <END>
they have not been commanded, mighty sovereign: <END>
please it your majesty to give me leave, <END>
i'll muster up my friends, and meet your grace <END>
where and what time your majesty shall please. <END>
ay, ay. thou wouldst be gone to join with richmond: <END>
i will not trust you, sir. <END>
most mighty sovereign, <END>
you have no cause to hold my friendship doubtful: <END>
i never was nor never will be false. <END>
well, <END>
go muster men; but, hear you, leave behind <END>
your son, george stanley: look your faith be firm. <END>
or else his head's assurance is but frail. <END>
so deal with him as i prove true to you. <END>
my gracious sovereign, now in devonshire, <END>
as i by friends am well advertised, <END>
sir edward courtney, and the haughty prelate <END>
bishop of exeter, his brother there, <END>
with many more confederates, are in arms. <END>
my liege, in kent the guildfords are in arms; <END>
and every hour more competitors <END>
flock to their aid, and still their power increaseth. <END>
my lord, the army of the duke of buckingham-- <END>
out on you, owls! nothing but songs of death? <END>
take that, until thou bring me better news. <END>
the news i have to tell your majesty <END>
is, that by sudden floods and fall of waters, <END>
buckingham's army is dispersed and scatter'd; <END>
and he himself wander'd away alone, <END>
no man knows whither. <END>
i cry thee mercy: <END>
there is my purse to cure that blow of thine. <END>
hath any well-advised friend proclaim'd <END>
reward to him that brings the traitor in? <END>
such proclamation hath been made, my liege. <END>
sir thomas lovel and lord marquis dorset, <END>
'tis said, my liege, in yorkshire are in arms. <END>
yet this good comfort bring i to your grace, <END>
the breton navy is dispersed by tempest: <END>
richmond, in yorkshire, sent out a boat <END>
unto the shore, to ask those on the banks <END>
if they were his assistants, yea or no; <END>
who answer'd him, they came from buckingham. <END>
upon his party: he, mistrusting them, <END>
hoisted sail and made away for brittany. <END>
march on, march on, since we are up in arms; <END>
if not to fight with foreign enemies, <END>
yet to beat down these rebels here at home. <END>
my liege, the duke of buckingham is taken; <END>
that is the best news: that the earl of richmond <END>
is with a mighty power landed at milford, <END>
is colder tidings, yet they must be told. <END>
away towards salisbury! while we reason here, <END>
a royal battle might be won and lost <END>
some one take order buckingham be brought <END>
to salisbury; the rest march on with me. <END>
sir christopher, tell richmond this from me: <END>
that in the sty of this most bloody boar <END>
my son george stanley is frank'd up in hold: <END>
if i revolt, off goes young george's head; <END>
the fear of that withholds my present aid. <END>
but, tell me, where is princely richmond now? <END>
at pembroke, or at harford-west, in wales. <END>
what men of name resort to him? <END>
sir walter herbert, a renowned soldier; <END>
sir gilbert talbot, sir william stanley; <END>
oxford, redoubted pembroke, sir james blunt, <END>
and rice ap thomas with a valiant crew; <END>
and many more of noble fame and worth: <END>
and towards london they do bend their course, <END>
if by the way they be not fought withal. <END>
return unto thy lord; commend me to him: <END>
tell him the queen hath heartily consented <END>
he shall espouse elizabeth her daughter. <END>
these letters will resolve him of my mind. farewell. <END>
will not king richard let me speak with him? <END>
no, my good lord; therefore be patient. <END>
hastings, and edward's children, rivers, grey, <END>
holy king henry, and thy fair son edward, <END>
vaughan, and all that have miscarried <END>
by underhand corrupted foul injustice, <END>
if that your moody discontented souls <END>
do through the clouds behold this present hour, <END>
even for revenge mock my destruction! <END>
this is all-souls' day, fellows, is it not? <END>
it is, my lord. <END>
why, then all-souls' day is my body's doomsday. <END>
this is the day that, in king edward's time, <END>
i wish't might fall on me, when i was found <END>
false to his children or his wife's allies <END>
this is the day wherein i wish'd to fall <END>
by the false faith of him i trusted most; <END>
this, this all-souls' day to my fearful soul <END>
is the determined respite of my wrongs: <END>
that high all-seer that i dallied with <END>
hath turn'd my feigned prayer on my head <END>
and given in earnest what i begg'd in jest. <END>
thus doth he force the swords of wicked men <END>
to turn their own points on their masters' bosoms: <END>
now margaret's curse is fallen upon my head; <END>
'when he,' quoth she, 'shall split thy heart with sorrow, <END>
remember margaret was a prophetess.' <END>
come, sirs, convey me to the block of shame; <END>
wrong hath but wrong, and blame the due of blame. <END>
fellows in arms, and my most loving friends, <END>
bruised underneath the yoke of tyranny, <END>
thus far into the bowels of the land <END>
have we march'd on without impediment; <END>
and here receive we from our father stanley <END>
lines of fair comfort and encouragement. <END>
the wretched, bloody, and usurping boar, <END>
that spoil'd your summer fields and fruitful vines, <END>
swills your warm blood like wash, and makes his trough <END>
in your embowell'd bosoms, this foul swine <END>
lies now even in the centre of this isle, <END>
near to the town of leicester, as we learn <END>
from tamworth thither is but one day's march. <END>
in god's name, cheerly on, courageous friends, <END>
to reap the harvest of perpetual peace <END>
by this one bloody trial of sharp war. <END>
every man's conscience is a thousand swords, <END>
to fight against that bloody homicide. <END>
i doubt not but his friends will fly to us. <END>
he hath no friends but who are friends for fear. <END>
which in his greatest need will shrink from him. <END>
all for our vantage. then, in god's name, march: <END>
true hope is swift, and flies with swallow's wings: <END>
kings it makes gods, and meaner creatures kings. <END>
here pitch our tents, even here in bosworth field. <END>
my lord of surrey, why look you so sad? <END>
my heart is ten times lighter than my looks. <END>
my lord of norfolk,-- <END>
here, most gracious liege. <END>
norfolk, we must have knocks; ha! must we not? <END>
we must both give and take, my gracious lord. <END>
up with my tent there! here will i lie tonight; <END>
but where to-morrow?  well, all's one for that. <END>
who hath descried the number of the foe? <END>
six or seven thousand is their utmost power. <END>
why, our battalion trebles that account: <END>
besides, the king's name is a tower of strength, <END>
which they upon the adverse party want. <END>
up with my tent there! valiant gentlemen, <END>
let us survey the vantage of the field <END>
call for some men of sound direction <END>
let's want no discipline, make no delay, <END>
for, lords, to-morrow is a busy day. <END>
the weary sun hath made a golden set, <END>
and by the bright track of his fiery car, <END>
gives signal, of a goodly day to-morrow. <END>
sir william brandon, you shall bear my standard. <END>
give me some ink and paper in my tent <END>
i'll draw the form and model of our battle, <END>
limit each leader to his several charge, <END>
and part in just proportion our small strength. <END>
my lord of oxford, you, sir william brandon, <END>
and you, sir walter herbert, stay with me. <END>
the earl of pembroke keeps his regiment: <END>
good captain blunt, bear my good night to him <END>
and by the second hour in the morning <END>
desire the earl to see me in my tent: <END>
yet one thing more, good blunt, before thou go'st, <END>
where is lord stanley quarter'd, dost thou know? <END>
unless i have mista'en his colours much, <END>
which well i am assured i have not done, <END>
his regiment lies half a mile at least <END>
south from the mighty power of the king. <END>
if without peril it be possible, <END>
good captain blunt, bear my good-night to him, <END>
and give him from me this most needful scroll. <END>
upon my life, my lord, i'll under-take it; <END>
and so, god give you quiet rest to-night! <END>
good night, good captain blunt. come gentlemen, <END>
let us consult upon to-morrow's business <END>
in to our tent; the air is raw and cold. <END>
what is't o'clock? <END>
it's supper-time, my lord; <END>
it's nine o'clock. <END>
i will not sup to-night. <END>
give me some ink and paper. <END>
what, is my beaver easier than it was? <END>
and all my armour laid into my tent? <END>
if is, my liege; and all things are in readiness. <END>
good norfolk, hie thee to thy charge; <END>
use careful watch, choose trusty sentinels. <END>
i go, my lord. <END>
stir with the lark to-morrow, gentle norfolk. <END>
i warrant you, my lord. <END>
catesby! <END>
my lord? <END>
send out a pursuivant at arms <END>
to stanley's regiment; bid him bring his power <END>
before sunrising, lest his son george fall <END>
into the blind cave of eternal night. <END>
fill me a bowl of wine. give me a watch. <END>
saddle white surrey for the field to-morrow. <END>
look that my staves be sound, and not too heavy. <END>
ratcliff! <END>
my lord? <END>
saw'st thou the melancholy lord northumberland? <END>
thomas the earl of surrey, and himself, <END>
much about cock-shut time, from troop to troop <END>
went through the army, cheering up the soldiers. <END>
so, i am satisfied. give me a bowl of wine: <END>
i have not that alacrity of spirit, <END>
nor cheer of mind, that i was wont to have. <END>
set it down. is ink and paper ready? <END>
it is, my lord. <END>
bid my guard watch; leave me. <END>
ratcliff, about the mid of night come to my tent <END>
and help to arm me. leave me, i say. <END>
fortune and victory sit on thy helm! <END>
all comfort that the dark night can afford <END>
be to thy person, noble father-in-law! <END>
tell me, how fares our loving mother? <END>
i, by attorney, bless thee from thy mother <END>
who prays continually for richmond's good: <END>
so much for that. the silent hours steal on, <END>
and flaky darkness breaks within the east. <END>
in brief,--for so the season bids us be,-- <END>
prepare thy battle early in the morning, <END>
and put thy fortune to the arbitrement <END>
of bloody strokes and mortal-staring war. <END>
i, as i may--that which i would i cannot,-- <END>
with best advantage will deceive the time, <END>
and aid thee in this doubtful shock of arms: <END>
but on thy side i may not be too forward <END>
lest, being seen, thy brother, tender george, <END>
be executed in his father's sight. <END>
cuts off the ceremonious vows of love <END>
and ample interchange of sweet discourse, <END>
which so long sunder'd friends should dwell upon: <END>
god give us leisure for these rites of love! <END>
once more, adieu: be valiant, and speed well! <END>
good lords, conduct him to his regiment: <END>
i'll strive, with troubled thoughts, to take a nap, <END>
lest leaden slumber peise me down to-morrow, <END>
when i should mount with wings of victory: <END>
once more, good night, kind lords and gentlemen. <END>
o thou, whose captain i account myself, <END>
look on my forces with a gracious eye; <END>
put in their hands thy bruising irons of wrath, <END>
that they may crush down with a heavy fall <END>
the usurping helmets of our adversaries! <END>
make us thy ministers of chastisement, <END>
that we may praise thee in the victory! <END>
to thee i do commend my watchful soul, <END>
ere i let fall the windows of mine eyes: <END>
sleeping and waking, o, defend me still! <END>
ghost of prince edward: <END>
ghost of king henry vi: <END>
ghost of clarence: <END>
ghost of rivers: <END>
ghost of grey: <END>
ghost of vaughan: <END>
ghost of hastings: <END>
ghosts of young princes: <END>
ghost of lady anne: <END>
ghost of buckingham: <END>
give me another horse: bind up my wounds. <END>
have mercy, jesu!--soft! i did but dream. <END>
o coward conscience, how dost thou afflict me! <END>
the lights burn blue. it is now dead midnight. <END>
cold fearful drops stand on my trembling flesh. <END>
what do i fear?  myself?  there's none else by: <END>
richard loves richard; that is, i am i. <END>
is there a murderer here?  no. yes, i am: <END>
then fly. what, from myself?   great reason why: <END>
lest i revenge. what, myself upon myself? <END>
alack. i love myself. wherefore?  for any good <END>
that i myself have done unto myself? <END>
o, no! alas, i rather hate myself <END>
for hateful deeds committed by myself! <END>
i am a villain: yet i lie. i am not. <END>
fool, of thyself speak well: fool, do not flatter. <END>
my conscience hath a thousand several tongues, <END>
and every tongue brings in a several tale, <END>
and every tale condemns me for a villain. <END>
perjury, perjury, in the high'st degree <END>
murder, stem murder, in the direst degree; <END>
all several sins, all used in each degree, <END>
throng to the bar, crying all, guilty! guilty! <END>
i shall despair. there is no creature loves me; <END>
and if i die, no soul shall pity me: <END>
nay, wherefore should they, since that i myself <END>
find in myself no pity to myself? <END>
methought the souls of all that i had murder'd <END>
came to my tent; and every one did threat <END>
to-morrow's vengeance on the head of richard. <END>
my lord! <END>
'zounds! who is there? <END>
ratcliff, my lord; 'tis i. the early village-cock <END>
hath twice done salutation to the morn; <END>
your friends are up, and buckle on their armour. <END>
o ratcliff, i have dream'd a fearful dream! <END>
what thinkest thou, will our friends prove all true? <END>
no doubt, my lord. <END>
o ratcliff, i fear, i fear,-- <END>
nay, good my lord, be not afraid of shadows. <END>
by the apostle paul, shadows to-night <END>
have struck more terror to the soul of richard <END>
than can the substance of ten thousand soldiers <END>
armed in proof, and led by shallow richmond. <END>
it is not yet near day. come, go with me; <END>
under our tents i'll play the eaves-dropper, <END>
to see if any mean to shrink from me. <END>
good morrow, richmond! <END>
cry mercy, lords and watchful gentlemen, <END>
that you have ta'en a tardy sluggard here. <END>
how have you slept, my lord? <END>
the sweetest sleep, and fairest-boding dreams <END>
that ever enter'd in a drowsy head, <END>
have i since your departure had, my lords. <END>
methought their souls, whose bodies richard murder'd, <END>
came to my tent, and cried on victory: <END>
i promise you, my soul is very jocund <END>
in the remembrance of so fair a dream. <END>
how far into the morning is it, lords? <END>
upon the stroke of four. <END>
why, then 'tis time to arm and give direction. <END>
more than i have said, loving countrymen, <END>
the leisure and enforcement of the time <END>
forbids to dwell upon: yet remember this, <END>
god and our good cause fight upon our side; <END>
the prayers of holy saints and wronged souls, <END>
like high-rear'd bulwarks, stand before our faces; <END>
richard except, those whom we fight against <END>
had rather have us win than him they follow: <END>
for what is he they follow?  truly, gentlemen, <END>
a bloody tyrant and a homicide; <END>
one raised in blood, and one in blood establish'd; <END>
one that made means to come by what he hath, <END>
and slaughter'd those that were the means to help him; <END>
abase foul stone, made precious by the foil <END>
of england's chair, where he is falsely set; <END>
one that hath ever been god's enemy: <END>
then, if you fight against god's enemy, <END>
god will in justice ward you as his soldiers; <END>
if you do sweat to put a tyrant down, <END>
you sleep in peace, the tyrant being slain; <END>
if you do fight against your country's foes, <END>
your country's fat shall pay your pains the hire; <END>
if you do fight in safeguard of your wives, <END>
your wives shall welcome home the conquerors; <END>
if you do free your children from the sword, <END>
your children's children quit it in your age. <END>
then, in the name of god and all these rights, <END>
advance your standards, draw your willing swords. <END>
for me, the ransom of my bold attempt <END>
shall be this cold corpse on the earth's cold face; <END>
but if i thrive, the gain of my attempt <END>
the least of you shall share his part thereof. <END>
sound drums and trumpets boldly and cheerfully; <END>
god and saint george! richmond and victory! <END>
what said northumberland as touching richmond? <END>
that he was never trained up in arms. <END>
he said the truth: and what said surrey then? <END>
he smiled and said 'the better for our purpose.' <END>
he was in the right; and so indeed it is. <END>
ten the clock there. give me a calendar. <END>
who saw the sun to-day? <END>
not i, my lord. <END>
then he disdains to shine; for by the book <END>
he should have braved the east an hour ago <END>
a black day will it be to somebody. ratcliff! <END>
my lord? <END>
the sun will not be seen to-day; <END>
the sky doth frown and lour upon our army. <END>
i would these dewy tears were from the ground. <END>
not shine to-day! why, what is that to me <END>
more than to richmond?  for the selfsame heaven <END>
that frowns on me looks sadly upon him. <END>
arm, arm, my lord; the foe vaunts in the field. <END>
come, bustle, bustle; caparison my horse. <END>
call up lord stanley, bid him bring his power: <END>
i will lead forth my soldiers to the plain, <END>
and thus my battle shall be ordered: <END>
my foreward shall be drawn out all in length, <END>
consisting equally of horse and foot; <END>
our archers shall be placed in the midst <END>
john duke of norfolk, thomas earl of surrey, <END>
shall have the leading of this foot and horse. <END>
they thus directed, we will follow <END>
in the main battle, whose puissance on either side <END>
shall be well winged with our chiefest horse. <END>
this, and saint george to boot! what think'st thou, norfolk? <END>
a good direction, warlike sovereign. <END>
this found i on my tent this morning. <END>
my lord, he doth deny to come. <END>
off with his son george's head! <END>
my lord, the enemy is past the marsh <END>
after the battle let george stanley die. <END>
a thousand hearts are great within my bosom: <END>
advance our standards, set upon our foes <END>
our ancient word of courage, fair saint george, <END>
inspire us with the spleen of fiery dragons! <END>
upon them! victory sits on our helms. <END>
rescue, my lord of norfolk, rescue, rescue! <END>
the king enacts more wonders than a man, <END>
daring an opposite to every danger: <END>
his horse is slain, and all on foot he fights, <END>
seeking for richmond in the throat of death. <END>
rescue, fair lord, or else the day is lost! <END>
a horse! a horse! my kingdom for a horse! <END>
withdraw, my lord; i'll help you to a horse. <END>
slave, i have set my life upon a cast, <END>
and i will stand the hazard of the die: <END>
i think there be six richmonds in the field; <END>
five have i slain to-day instead of him. <END>
a horse! a horse! my kingdom for a horse! <END>
god and your arms be praised, victorious friends, <END>
the day is ours, the bloody dog is dead. <END>
courageous richmond, well hast thou acquit thee. <END>
lo, here, this long-usurped royalty <END>
from the dead temples of this bloody wretch <END>
have i pluck'd off, to grace thy brows withal: <END>
wear it, enjoy it, and make much of it. <END>
great god of heaven, say amen to all! <END>
but, tell me, is young george stanley living? <END>
he is, my lord, and safe in leicester town; <END>
whither, if it please you, we may now withdraw us. <END>
what men of name are slain on either side? <END>
john duke of norfolk, walter lord ferrers, <END>
sir robert brakenbury, and sir william brandon. <END>
inter their bodies as becomes their births: <END>
proclaim a pardon to the soldiers fled <END>
that in submission will return to us: <END>
and then, as we have ta'en the sacrament, <END>
we will unite the white rose and the red: <END>
smile heaven upon this fair conjunction, <END>
that long have frown'd upon their enmity! <END>
what traitor hears me, and says not amen? <END>
england hath long been mad, and scarr'd herself; <END>
the brother blindly shed the brother's blood, <END>
the father rashly slaughter'd his own son, <END>
the son, compell'd, been butcher to the sire: <END>
all this divided york and lancaster, <END>
divided in their dire division, <END>
o, now, let richmond and elizabeth, <END>
the true succeeders of each royal house, <END>
by god's fair ordinance conjoin together! <END>
and let their heirs, god, if thy will be so. <END>
enrich the time to come with smooth-faced peace, <END>
with smiling plenty and fair prosperous days! <END>
abate the edge of traitors, gracious lord, <END>
that would reduce these bloody days again, <END>
and make poor england weep in streams of blood! <END>
let them not live to taste this land's increase <END>
that would with treason wound this fair land's peace! <END>
now civil wounds are stopp'd, peace lives again: <END>
that she may long live here, god say amen! <END>
old john of gaunt, time-honour'd lancaster, <END>
hast thou, according to thy oath and band, <END>
brought hither henry hereford thy bold son, <END>
here to make good the boisterous late appeal, <END>
which then our leisure would not let us hear, <END>
against the duke of norfolk, thomas mowbray? <END>
i have, my liege. <END>
tell me, moreover, hast thou sounded him, <END>
if he appeal the duke on ancient malice; <END>
or worthily, as a good subject should, <END>
on some known ground of treachery in him? <END>
as near as i could sift him on that argument, <END>
on some apparent danger seen in him <END>
aim'd at your highness, no inveterate malice. <END>
then call them to our presence; face to face, <END>
and frowning brow to brow, ourselves will hear <END>
the accuser and the accused freely speak: <END>
high-stomach'd are they both, and full of ire, <END>
in rage deaf as the sea, hasty as fire. <END>
many years of happy days befal <END>
my gracious sovereign, my most loving liege! <END>
each day still better other's happiness; <END>
until the heavens, envying earth's good hap, <END>
add an immortal title to your crown! <END>
we thank you both: yet one but flatters us, <END>
as well appeareth by the cause you come; <END>
namely to appeal each other of high treason. <END>
cousin of hereford, what dost thou object <END>
against the duke of norfolk, thomas mowbray? <END>
first, heaven be the record to my speech! <END>
in the devotion of a subject's love, <END>
tendering the precious safety of my prince, <END>
and free from other misbegotten hate, <END>
come i appellant to this princely presence. <END>
now, thomas mowbray, do i turn to thee, <END>
and mark my greeting well; for what i speak <END>
my body shall make good upon this earth, <END>
or my divine soul answer it in heaven. <END>
thou art a traitor and a miscreant, <END>
too good to be so and too bad to live, <END>
since the more fair and crystal is the sky, <END>
the uglier seem the clouds that in it fly. <END>
once more, the more to aggravate the note, <END>
with a foul traitor's name stuff i thy throat; <END>
and wish, so please my sovereign, ere i move, <END>
what my tongue speaks my right drawn sword may prove. <END>
let not my cold words here accuse my zeal: <END>
'tis not the trial of a woman's war, <END>
the bitter clamour of two eager tongues, <END>
can arbitrate this cause betwixt us twain; <END>
the blood is hot that must be cool'd for this: <END>
yet can i not of such tame patience boast <END>
as to be hush'd and nought at all to say: <END>
first, the fair reverence of your highness curbs me <END>
from giving reins and spurs to my free speech; <END>
which else would post until it had return'd <END>
these terms of treason doubled down his throat. <END>
setting aside his high blood's royalty, <END>
and let him be no kinsman to my liege, <END>
i do defy him, and i spit at him; <END>
call him a slanderous coward and a villain: <END>
which to maintain i would allow him odds, <END>
and meet him, were i tied to run afoot <END>
even to the frozen ridges of the alps, <END>
or any other ground inhabitable, <END>
where ever englishman durst set his foot. <END>
mean time let this defend my loyalty, <END>
by all my hopes, most falsely doth he lie. <END>
pale trembling coward, there i throw my gage, <END>
disclaiming here the kindred of the king, <END>
and lay aside my high blood's royalty, <END>
which fear, not reverence, makes thee to except. <END>
if guilty dread have left thee so much strength <END>
as to take up mine honour's pawn, then stoop: <END>
by that and all the rites of knighthood else, <END>
will i make good against thee, arm to arm, <END>
what i have spoke, or thou canst worse devise. <END>
i take it up; and by that sword i swear <END>
which gently laid my knighthood on my shoulder, <END>
i'll answer thee in any fair degree, <END>
or chivalrous design of knightly trial: <END>
and when i mount, alive may i not light, <END>
if i be traitor or unjustly fight! <END>
what doth our cousin lay to mowbray's charge? <END>
it must be great that can inherit us <END>
so much as of a thought of ill in him. <END>
look, what i speak, my life shall prove it true; <END>
that mowbray hath received eight thousand nobles <END>
in name of lendings for your highness' soldiers, <END>
the which he hath detain'd for lewd employments, <END>
like a false traitor and injurious villain. <END>
besides i say and will in battle prove, <END>
or here or elsewhere to the furthest verge <END>
that ever was survey'd by english eye, <END>
that all the treasons for these eighteen years <END>
complotted and contrived in this land <END>
fetch from false mowbray their first head and spring. <END>
further i say and further will maintain <END>
upon his bad life to make all this good, <END>
that he did plot the duke of gloucester's death, <END>
suggest his soon-believing adversaries, <END>
and consequently, like a traitor coward, <END>
sluiced out his innocent soul through streams of blood: <END>
which blood, like sacrificing abel's, cries, <END>
even from the tongueless caverns of the earth, <END>
to me for justice and rough chastisement; <END>
and, by the glorious worth of my descent, <END>
this arm shall do it, or this life be spent. <END>
how high a pitch his resolution soars! <END>
thomas of norfolk, what say'st thou to this? <END>
o, let my sovereign turn away his face <END>
and bid his ears a little while be deaf, <END>
till i have told this slander of his blood, <END>
how god and good men hate so foul a liar. <END>
mowbray, impartial are our eyes and ears: <END>
were he my brother, nay, my kingdom's heir, <END>
as he is but my father's brother's son, <END>
now, by my sceptre's awe, i make a vow, <END>
such neighbour nearness to our sacred blood <END>
should nothing privilege him, nor partialize <END>
the unstooping firmness of my upright soul: <END>
he is our subject, mowbray; so art thou: <END>
free speech and fearless i to thee allow. <END>
then, bolingbroke, as low as to thy heart, <END>
through the false passage of thy throat, thou liest. <END>
three parts of that receipt i had for calais <END>
disbursed i duly to his highness' soldiers; <END>
the other part reserved i by consent, <END>
for that my sovereign liege was in my debt <END>
upon remainder of a dear account, <END>
since last i went to france to fetch his queen: <END>
now swallow down that lie. for gloucester's death, <END>
i slew him not; but to my own disgrace <END>
neglected my sworn duty in that case. <END>
for you, my noble lord of lancaster, <END>
the honourable father to my foe <END>
once did i lay an ambush for your life, <END>
a trespass that doth vex my grieved soul <END>
but ere i last received the sacrament <END>
i did confess it, and exactly begg'd <END>
your grace's pardon, and i hope i had it. <END>
this is my fault: as for the rest appeall'd, <END>
it issues from the rancour of a villain, <END>
a recreant and most degenerate traitor <END>
which in myself i boldly will defend; <END>
and interchangeably hurl down my gage <END>
upon this overweening traitor's foot, <END>
to prove myself a loyal gentleman <END>
even in the best blood chamber'd in his bosom. <END>
in haste whereof, most heartily i pray <END>
your highness to assign our trial day. <END>
wrath-kindled gentlemen, be ruled by me; <END>
let's purge this choler without letting blood: <END>
this we prescribe, though no physician; <END>
deep malice makes too deep incision; <END>
forget, forgive; conclude and be agreed; <END>
our doctors say this is no month to bleed. <END>
good uncle, let this end where it begun; <END>
we'll calm the duke of norfolk, you your son. <END>
to be a make-peace shall become my age: <END>
throw down, my son, the duke of norfolk's gage. <END>
and, norfolk, throw down his. <END>
when, harry, when? <END>
obedience bids i should not bid again. <END>
norfolk, throw down, we bid; there is no boot. <END>
myself i throw, dread sovereign, at thy foot. <END>
my life thou shalt command, but not my shame: <END>
the one my duty owes; but my fair name, <END>
despite of death that lives upon my grave, <END>
to dark dishonour's use thou shalt not have. <END>
i am disgraced, impeach'd and baffled here, <END>
pierced to the soul with slander's venom'd spear, <END>
the which no balm can cure but his heart-blood <END>
which breathed this poison. <END>
rage must be withstood: <END>
give me his gage: lions make leopards tame. <END>
yea, but not change his spots: take but my shame. <END>
and i resign my gage. my dear dear lord, <END>
the purest treasure mortal times afford <END>
is spotless reputation: that away, <END>
men are but gilded loam or painted clay. <END>
a jewel in a ten-times-barr'd-up chest <END>
is a bold spirit in a loyal breast. <END>
mine honour is my life; both grow in one: <END>
take honour from me, and my life is done: <END>
then, dear my liege, mine honour let me try; <END>
in that i live and for that will i die. <END>
cousin, throw up your gage; do you begin. <END>
o, god defend my soul from such deep sin! <END>
shall i seem crest-fall'n in my father's sight? <END>
or with pale beggar-fear impeach my height <END>
before this out-dared dastard? ere my tongue <END>
shall wound my honour with such feeble wrong, <END>
or sound so base a parle, my teeth shall tear <END>
the slavish motive of recanting fear, <END>
and spit it bleeding in his high disgrace, <END>
where shame doth harbour, even in mowbray's face. <END>
we were not born to sue, but to command; <END>
which since we cannot do to make you friends, <END>
be ready, as your lives shall answer it, <END>
at coventry, upon saint lambert's day: <END>
there shall your swords and lances arbitrate <END>
the swelling difference of your settled hate: <END>
since we can not atone you, we shall see <END>
justice design the victor's chivalry. <END>
lord marshal, command our officers at arms <END>
be ready to direct these home alarms. <END>
alas, the part i had in woodstock's blood <END>
doth more solicit me than your exclaims, <END>
to stir against the butchers of his life! <END>
but since correction lieth in those hands <END>
which made the fault that we cannot correct, <END>
put we our quarrel to the will of heaven; <END>
who, when they see the hours ripe on earth, <END>
will rain hot vengeance on offenders' heads. <END>
finds brotherhood in thee no sharper spur? <END>
hath love in thy old blood no living fire? <END>
edward's seven sons, whereof thyself art one, <END>
were as seven vials of his sacred blood, <END>
or seven fair branches springing from one root: <END>
some of those seven are dried by nature's course, <END>
some of those branches by the destinies cut; <END>
but thomas, my dear lord, my life, my gloucester, <END>
one vial full of edward's sacred blood, <END>
one flourishing branch of his most royal root, <END>
is crack'd, and all the precious liquor spilt, <END>
is hack'd down, and his summer leaves all faded, <END>
by envy's hand and murder's bloody axe. <END>
ah, gaunt, his blood was thine! that bed, that womb, <END>
that metal, that self-mould, that fashion'd thee <END>
made him a man; and though thou livest and breathest, <END>
yet art thou slain in him: thou dost consent <END>
in some large measure to thy father's death, <END>
in that thou seest thy wretched brother die, <END>
who was the model of thy father's life. <END>
call it not patience, gaunt; it is despair: <END>
in suffering thus thy brother to be slaughter'd, <END>
thou showest the naked pathway to thy life, <END>
teaching stern murder how to butcher thee: <END>
that which in mean men we intitle patience <END>
is pale cold cowardice in noble breasts. <END>
what shall i say? to safeguard thine own life, <END>
the best way is to venge my gloucester's death. <END>
god's is the quarrel; for god's substitute, <END>
his deputy anointed in his sight, <END>
hath caused his death: the which if wrongfully, <END>
let heaven revenge; for i may never lift <END>
an angry arm against his minister. <END>
where then, alas, may i complain myself? <END>
to god, the widow's champion and defence. <END>
why, then, i will. farewell, old gaunt. <END>
thou goest to coventry, there to behold <END>
our cousin hereford and fell mowbray fight: <END>
o, sit my husband's wrongs on hereford's spear, <END>
that it may enter butcher mowbray's breast! <END>
or, if misfortune miss the first career, <END>
be mowbray's sins so heavy in his bosom, <END>
they may break his foaming courser's back, <END>
and throw the rider headlong in the lists, <END>
a caitiff recreant to my cousin hereford! <END>
farewell, old gaunt: thy sometimes brother's wife <END>
with her companion grief must end her life. <END>
sister, farewell; i must to coventry: <END>
as much good stay with thee as go with me! <END>
yet one word more: grief boundeth where it falls, <END>
not with the empty hollowness, but weight: <END>
i take my leave before i have begun, <END>
for sorrow ends not when it seemeth done. <END>
commend me to thy brother, edmund york. <END>
lo, this is all:--nay, yet depart not so; <END>
though this be all, do not so quickly go; <END>
i shall remember more. bid him--ah, what?-- <END>
with all good speed at plashy visit me. <END>
alack, and what shall good old york there see <END>
but empty lodgings and unfurnish'd walls, <END>
unpeopled offices, untrodden stones? <END>
and what hear there for welcome but my groans? <END>
therefore commend me; let him not come there, <END>
to seek out sorrow that dwells every where. <END>
desolate, desolate, will i hence and die: <END>
the last leave of thee takes my weeping eye. <END>
my lord aumerle, is harry hereford arm'd? <END>
yea, at all points; and longs to enter in. <END>
the duke of norfolk, sprightfully and bold, <END>
stays but the summons of the appellant's trumpet. <END>
why, then, the champions are prepared, and stay <END>
for nothing but his majesty's approach. <END>
marshal, demand of yonder champion <END>
the cause of his arrival here in arms: <END>
ask him his name and orderly proceed <END>
to swear him in the justice of his cause. <END>
in god's name and the king's, say who thou art <END>
and why thou comest thus knightly clad in arms, <END>
against what man thou comest, and what thy quarrel: <END>
speak truly, on thy knighthood and thy oath; <END>
as so defend thee heaven and thy valour! <END>
my name is thomas mowbray, duke of norfolk; <END>
who hither come engaged by my oath-- <END>
which god defend a knight should violate!-- <END>
both to defend my loyalty and truth <END>
to god, my king and my succeeding issue, <END>
against the duke of hereford that appeals me <END>
and, by the grace of god and this mine arm, <END>
to prove him, in defending of myself, <END>
a traitor to my god, my king, and me: <END>
and as i truly fight, defend me heaven! <END>
marshal, ask yonder knight in arms, <END>
both who he is and why he cometh hither <END>
thus plated in habiliments of war, <END>
and formally, according to our law, <END>
depose him in the justice of his cause. <END>
what is thy name? and wherefore comest thou hither, <END>
before king richard in his royal lists? <END>
against whom comest thou? and what's thy quarrel? <END>
speak like a true knight, so defend thee heaven! <END>
harry of hereford, lancaster and derby <END>
am i; who ready here do stand in arms, <END>
to prove, by god's grace and my body's valour, <END>
in lists, on thomas mowbray, duke of norfolk, <END>
that he is a traitor, foul and dangerous, <END>
to god of heaven, king richard and to me; <END>
and as i truly fight, defend me heaven! <END>
on pain of death, no person be so bold <END>
or daring-hardy as to touch the lists, <END>
except the marshal and such officers <END>
appointed to direct these fair designs. <END>
lord marshal, let me kiss my sovereign's hand, <END>
and bow my knee before his majesty: <END>
for mowbray and myself are like two men <END>
that vow a long and weary pilgrimage; <END>
then let us take a ceremonious leave <END>
and loving farewell of our several friends. <END>
the appellant in all duty greets your highness, <END>
and craves to kiss your hand and take his leave. <END>
we will descend and fold him in our arms. <END>
cousin of hereford, as thy cause is right, <END>
so be thy fortune in this royal fight! <END>
farewell, my blood; which if to-day thou shed, <END>
lament we may, but not revenge thee dead. <END>
o let no noble eye profane a tear <END>
for me, if i be gored with mowbray's spear: <END>
as confident as is the falcon's flight <END>
against a bird, do i with mowbray fight. <END>
my loving lord, i take my leave of you; <END>
of you, my noble cousin, lord aumerle; <END>
not sick, although i have to do with death, <END>
but lusty, young, and cheerly drawing breath. <END>
lo, as at english feasts, so i regreet <END>
the daintiest last, to make the end most sweet: <END>
o thou, the earthly author of my blood, <END>
whose youthful spirit, in me regenerate, <END>
doth with a twofold vigour lift me up <END>
to reach at victory above my head, <END>
add proof unto mine armour with thy prayers; <END>
and with thy blessings steel my lance's point, <END>
that it may enter mowbray's waxen coat, <END>
and furbish new the name of john a gaunt, <END>
even in the lusty havior of his son. <END>
god in thy good cause make thee prosperous! <END>
be swift like lightning in the execution; <END>
and let thy blows, doubly redoubled, <END>
fall like amazing thunder on the casque <END>
of thy adverse pernicious enemy: <END>
rouse up thy youthful blood, be valiant and live. <END>
mine innocency and saint george to thrive! <END>
however god or fortune cast my lot, <END>
there lives or dies, true to king richard's throne, <END>
a loyal, just and upright gentleman: <END>
never did captive with a freer heart <END>
cast off his chains of bondage and embrace <END>
his golden uncontroll'd enfranchisement, <END>
more than my dancing soul doth celebrate <END>
this feast of battle with mine adversary. <END>
most mighty liege, and my companion peers, <END>
take from my mouth the wish of happy years: <END>
as gentle and as jocund as to jest <END>
go i to fight: truth hath a quiet breast. <END>
farewell, my lord: securely i espy <END>
virtue with valour couched in thine eye. <END>
order the trial, marshal, and begin. <END>
harry of hereford, lancaster and derby, <END>
receive thy lance; and god defend the right! <END>
strong as a tower in hope, i cry amen. <END>
go bear this lance to thomas, duke of norfolk. <END>
harry of hereford, lancaster and derby, <END>
stands here for god, his sovereign and himself, <END>
on pain to be found false and recreant, <END>
to prove the duke of norfolk, thomas mowbray, <END>
a traitor to his god, his king and him; <END>
and dares him to set forward to the fight. <END>
here standeth thomas mowbray, duke of norfolk, <END>
on pain to be found false and recreant, <END>
both to defend himself and to approve <END>
henry of hereford, lancaster, and derby, <END>
to god, his sovereign and to him disloyal; <END>
courageously and with a free desire <END>
attending but the signal to begin. <END>
sound, trumpets; and set forward, combatants. <END>
stay, the king hath thrown his warder down. <END>
let them lay by their helmets and their spears, <END>
and both return back to their chairs again: <END>
withdraw with us: and let the trumpets sound <END>
while we return these dukes what we decree. <END>
draw near, <END>
and list what with our council we have done. <END>
for that our kingdom's earth should not be soil'd <END>
with that dear blood which it hath fostered; <END>
and for our eyes do hate the dire aspect <END>
of civil wounds plough'd up with neighbours' sword; <END>
and for we think the eagle-winged pride <END>
of sky-aspiring and ambitious thoughts, <END>
with rival-hating envy, set on you <END>
to wake our peace, which in our country's cradle <END>
draws the sweet infant breath of gentle sleep; <END>
which so roused up with boisterous untuned drums, <END>
with harsh resounding trumpets' dreadful bray, <END>
and grating shock of wrathful iron arms, <END>
might from our quiet confines fright fair peace <END>
and make us wade even in our kindred's blood, <END>
therefore, we banish you our territories: <END>
you, cousin hereford, upon pain of life, <END>
till twice five summers have enrich'd our fields <END>
shall not regreet our fair dominions, <END>
but tread the stranger paths of banishment. <END>
your will be done: this must my comfort be, <END>
sun that warms you here shall shine on me; <END>
and those his golden beams to you here lent <END>
shall point on me and gild my banishment. <END>
norfolk, for thee remains a heavier doom, <END>
which i with some unwillingness pronounce: <END>
the sly slow hours shall not determinate <END>
the dateless limit of thy dear exile; <END>
the hopeless word of 'never to return' <END>
breathe i against thee, upon pain of life. <END>
a heavy sentence, my most sovereign liege, <END>
and all unlook'd for from your highness' mouth: <END>
a dearer merit, not so deep a maim <END>
as to be cast forth in the common air, <END>
have i deserved at your highness' hands. <END>
the language i have learn'd these forty years, <END>
my native english, now i must forego: <END>
and now my tongue's use is to me no more <END>
than an unstringed viol or a harp, <END>
or like a cunning instrument cased up, <END>
or, being open, put into his hands <END>
that knows no touch to tune the harmony: <END>
within my mouth you have engaol'd my tongue, <END>
doubly portcullis'd with my teeth and lips; <END>
and dull unfeeling barren ignorance <END>
is made my gaoler to attend on me. <END>
i am too old to fawn upon a nurse, <END>
too far in years to be a pupil now: <END>
what is thy sentence then but speechless death, <END>
which robs my tongue from breathing native breath? <END>
it boots thee not to be compassionate: <END>
after our sentence plaining comes too late. <END>
then thus i turn me from my country's light, <END>
to dwell in solemn shades of endless night. <END>
return again, and take an oath with thee. <END>
lay on our royal sword your banish'd hands; <END>
swear by the duty that you owe to god-- <END>
our part therein we banish with yourselves-- <END>
to keep the oath that we administer: <END>
you never shall, so help you truth and god! <END>
embrace each other's love in banishment; <END>
nor never look upon each other's face; <END>
nor never write, regreet, nor reconcile <END>
this louring tempest of your home-bred hate; <END>
nor never by advised purpose meet <END>
to plot, contrive, or complot any ill <END>
'gainst us, our state, our subjects, or our land. <END>
i swear. <END>
and i, to keep all this. <END>
norfolk, so far as to mine enemy:-- <END>
by this time, had the king permitted us, <END>
one of our souls had wander'd in the air. <END>
banish'd this frail sepulchre of our flesh, <END>
as now our flesh is banish'd from this land: <END>
confess thy treasons ere thou fly the realm; <END>
since thou hast far to go, bear not along <END>
the clogging burthen of a guilty soul. <END>
no, bolingbroke: if ever i were traitor, <END>
my name be blotted from the book of life, <END>
and i from heaven banish'd as from hence! <END>
but what thou art, god, thou, and i do know; <END>
and all too soon, i fear, the king shall rue. <END>
farewell, my liege. now no way can i stray; <END>
save back to england, all the world's my way. <END>
uncle, even in the glasses of thine eyes <END>
i see thy grieved heart: thy sad aspect <END>
hath from the number of his banish'd years <END>
pluck'd four away. <END>
six frozen winter spent, <END>
return with welcome home from banishment. <END>
how long a time lies in one little word! <END>
four lagging winters and four wanton springs <END>
end in a word: such is the breath of kings. <END>
i thank my liege, that in regard of me <END>
he shortens four years of my son's exile: <END>
but little vantage shall i reap thereby; <END>
for, ere the six years that he hath to spend <END>
can change their moons and bring their times about <END>
my oil-dried lamp and time-bewasted light <END>
shall be extinct with age and endless night; <END>
my inch of taper will be burnt and done, <END>
and blindfold death not let me see my son. <END>
why uncle, thou hast many years to live. <END>
but not a minute, king, that thou canst give: <END>
shorten my days thou canst with sullen sorrow, <END>
and pluck nights from me, but not lend a morrow; <END>
thou canst help time to furrow me with age, <END>
but stop no wrinkle in his pilgrimage; <END>
thy word is current with him for my death, <END>
but dead, thy kingdom cannot buy my breath. <END>
thy son is banish'd upon good advice, <END>
whereto thy tongue a party-verdict gave: <END>
why at our justice seem'st thou then to lour? <END>
things sweet to taste prove in digestion sour. <END>
you urged me as a judge; but i had rather <END>
you would have bid me argue like a father. <END>
o, had it been a stranger, not my child, <END>
to smooth his fault i should have been more mild: <END>
a partial slander sought i to avoid, <END>
and in the sentence my own life destroy'd. <END>
alas, i look'd when some of you should say, <END>
i was too strict to make mine own away; <END>
but you gave leave to my unwilling tongue <END>
against my will to do myself this wrong. <END>
cousin, farewell; and, uncle, bid him so: <END>
six years we banish him, and he shall go. <END>
cousin, farewell: what presence must not know, <END>
from where you do remain let paper show. <END>
my lord, no leave take i; for i will ride, <END>
as far as land will let me, by your side. <END>
o, to what purpose dost thou hoard thy words, <END>
that thou return'st no greeting to thy friends? <END>
i have too few to take my leave of you, <END>
when the tongue's office should be prodigal <END>
to breathe the abundant dolour of the heart. <END>
thy grief is but thy absence for a time. <END>
joy absent, grief is present for that time. <END>
what is six winters? they are quickly gone. <END>
to men in joy; but grief makes one hour ten. <END>
call it a travel that thou takest for pleasure. <END>
my heart will sigh when i miscall it so, <END>
which finds it an inforced pilgrimage. <END>
the sullen passage of thy weary steps <END>
esteem as foil wherein thou art to set <END>
the precious jewel of thy home return. <END>
nay, rather, every tedious stride i make <END>
will but remember me what a deal of world <END>
i wander from the jewels that i love. <END>
must i not serve a long apprenticehood <END>
to foreign passages, and in the end, <END>
having my freedom, boast of nothing else <END>
but that i was a journeyman to grief? <END>
all places that the eye of heaven visits <END>
are to a wise man ports and happy havens. <END>
teach thy necessity to reason thus; <END>
there is no virtue like necessity. <END>
think not the king did banish thee, <END>
but thou the king. woe doth the heavier sit, <END>
where it perceives it is but faintly borne. <END>
go, say i sent thee forth to purchase honour <END>
and not the king exiled thee; or suppose <END>
devouring pestilence hangs in our air <END>
and thou art flying to a fresher clime: <END>
look, what thy soul holds dear, imagine it <END>
to lie that way thou go'st, not whence thou comest: <END>
suppose the singing birds musicians, <END>
the grass whereon thou tread'st the presence strew'd, <END>
the flowers fair ladies, and thy steps no more <END>
than a delightful measure or a dance; <END>
for gnarling sorrow hath less power to bite <END>
the man that mocks at it and sets it light. <END>
o, who can hold a fire in his hand <END>
by thinking on the frosty caucasus? <END>
or cloy the hungry edge of appetite <END>
by bare imagination of a feast? <END>
or wallow naked in december snow <END>
by thinking on fantastic summer's heat? <END>
o, no! the apprehension of the good <END>
gives but the greater feeling to the worse: <END>
fell sorrow's tooth doth never rankle more <END>
than when he bites, but lanceth not the sore. <END>
come, come, my son, i'll bring thee on thy way: <END>
had i thy youth and cause, i would not stay. <END>
then, england's ground, farewell; sweet soil, adieu; <END>
my mother, and my nurse, that bears me yet! <END>
where'er i wander, boast of this i can, <END>
though banish'd, yet a trueborn englishman. <END>
we did observe. cousin aumerle, <END>
how far brought you high hereford on his way? <END>
i brought high hereford, if you call him so, <END>
but to the next highway, and there i left him. <END>
and say, what store of parting tears were shed? <END>
faith, none for me; except the north-east wind, <END>
which then blew bitterly against our faces, <END>
awaked the sleeping rheum, and so by chance <END>
did grace our hollow parting with a tear. <END>
what said our cousin when you parted with him? <END>
'farewell:' <END>
and, for my heart disdained that my tongue <END>
should so profane the word, that taught me craft <END>
to counterfeit oppression of such grief <END>
that words seem'd buried in my sorrow's grave. <END>
marry, would the word 'farewell' have lengthen'd hours <END>
and added years to his short banishment, <END>
he should have had a volume of farewells; <END>
but since it would not, he had none of me. <END>
he is our cousin, cousin; but 'tis doubt, <END>
when time shall call him home from banishment, <END>
whether our kinsman come to see his friends. <END>
ourself and bushy, bagot here and green <END>
observed his courtship to the common people; <END>
how he did seem to dive into their hearts <END>
with humble and familiar courtesy, <END>
what reverence he did throw away on slaves, <END>
wooing poor craftsmen with the craft of smiles <END>
and patient underbearing of his fortune, <END>
as 'twere to banish their affects with him. <END>
off goes his bonnet to an oyster-wench; <END>
a brace of draymen bid god speed him well <END>
and had the tribute of his supple knee, <END>
with 'thanks, my countrymen, my loving friends;' <END>
as were our england in reversion his, <END>
and he our subjects' next degree in hope. <END>
well, he is gone; and with him go these thoughts. <END>
now for the rebels which stand out in ireland, <END>
expedient manage must be made, my liege, <END>
ere further leisure yield them further means <END>
for their advantage and your highness' loss. <END>
we will ourself in person to this war: <END>
and, for our coffers, with too great a court <END>
and liberal largess, are grown somewhat light, <END>
we are inforced to farm our royal realm; <END>
the revenue whereof shall furnish us <END>
for our affairs in hand: if that come short, <END>
our substitutes at home shall have blank charters; <END>
whereto, when they shall know what men are rich, <END>
they shall subscribe them for large sums of gold <END>
and send them after to supply our wants; <END>
for we will make for ireland presently. <END>
bushy, what news? <END>
old john of gaunt is grievous sick, my lord, <END>
suddenly taken; and hath sent post haste <END>
to entreat your majesty to visit him. <END>
where lies he? <END>
at ely house. <END>
now put it, god, in the physician's mind <END>
to help him to his grave immediately! <END>
the lining of his coffers shall make coats <END>
to deck our soldiers for these irish wars. <END>
come, gentlemen, let's all go visit him: <END>
pray god we may make haste, and come too late! <END>
amen. <END>
will the king come, that i may breathe my last <END>
in wholesome counsel to his unstaid youth? <END>
vex not yourself, nor strive not with your breath; <END>
for all in vain comes counsel to his ear. <END>
o, but they say the tongues of dying men <END>
enforce attention like deep harmony: <END>
where words are scarce, they are seldom spent in vain, <END>
for they breathe truth that breathe their words in pain. <END>
he that no more must say is listen'd more <END>
than they whom youth and ease have taught to glose; <END>
more are men's ends mark'd than their lives before: <END>
the setting sun, and music at the close, <END>
as the last taste of sweets, is sweetest last, <END>
writ in remembrance more than things long past: <END>
though richard my life's counsel would not hear, <END>
my death's sad tale may yet undeaf his ear. <END>
no; it is stopp'd with other flattering sounds, <END>
as praises, of whose taste the wise are fond, <END>
lascivious metres, to whose venom sound <END>
the open ear of youth doth always listen; <END>
report of fashions in proud italy, <END>
whose manners still our tardy apish nation <END>
limps after in base imitation. <END>
where doth the world thrust forth a vanity-- <END>
so it be new, there's no respect how vile-- <END>
that is not quickly buzzed into his ears? <END>
then all too late comes counsel to be heard, <END>
where will doth mutiny with wit's regard. <END>
direct not him whose way himself will choose: <END>
'tis breath thou lack'st, and that breath wilt thou lose. <END>
methinks i am a prophet new inspired <END>
and thus expiring do foretell of him: <END>
his rash fierce blaze of riot cannot last, <END>
for violent fires soon burn out themselves; <END>
small showers last long, but sudden storms are short; <END>
he tires betimes that spurs too fast betimes; <END>
with eager feeding food doth choke the feeder: <END>
light vanity, insatiate cormorant, <END>
consuming means, soon preys upon itself. <END>
this royal throne of kings, this scepter'd isle, <END>
this earth of majesty, this seat of mars, <END>
this other eden, demi-paradise, <END>
this fortress built by nature for herself <END>
against infection and the hand of war, <END>
this happy breed of men, this little world, <END>
this precious stone set in the silver sea, <END>
which serves it in the office of a wall, <END>
or as a moat defensive to a house, <END>
against the envy of less happier lands, <END>
this blessed plot, this earth, this realm, this england, <END>
this nurse, this teeming womb of royal kings, <END>
fear'd by their breed and famous by their birth, <END>
renowned for their deeds as far from home, <END>
for christian service and true chivalry, <END>
as is the sepulchre in stubborn jewry, <END>
of the world's ransom, blessed mary's son, <END>
this land of such dear souls, this dear dear land, <END>
dear for her reputation through the world, <END>
is now leased out, i die pronouncing it, <END>
like to a tenement or pelting farm: <END>
england, bound in with the triumphant sea <END>
whose rocky shore beats back the envious siege <END>
of watery neptune, is now bound in with shame, <END>
with inky blots and rotten parchment bonds: <END>
that england, that was wont to conquer others, <END>
hath made a shameful conquest of itself. <END>
ah, would the scandal vanish with my life, <END>
how happy then were my ensuing death! <END>
the king is come: deal mildly with his youth; <END>
for young hot colts being raged do rage the more. <END>
how fares our noble uncle, lancaster? <END>
what comfort, man? how is't with aged gaunt? <END>
o how that name befits my composition! <END>
old gaunt indeed, and gaunt in being old: <END>
within me grief hath kept a tedious fast; <END>
and who abstains from meat that is not gaunt? <END>
for sleeping england long time have i watch'd; <END>
watching breeds leanness, leanness is all gaunt: <END>
the pleasure that some fathers feed upon, <END>
is my strict fast; i mean, my children's looks; <END>
and therein fasting, hast thou made me gaunt: <END>
gaunt am i for the grave, gaunt as a grave, <END>
whose hollow womb inherits nought but bones. <END>
can sick men play so nicely with their names? <END>
no, misery makes sport to mock itself: <END>
since thou dost seek to kill my name in me, <END>
i mock my name, great king, to flatter thee. <END>
should dying men flatter with those that live? <END>
no, no, men living flatter those that die. <END>
thou, now a-dying, say'st thou flatterest me. <END>
o, no! thou diest, though i the sicker be. <END>
i am in health, i breathe, and see thee ill. <END>
now he that made me knows i see thee ill; <END>
ill in myself to see, and in thee seeing ill. <END>
thy death-bed is no lesser than thy land <END>
wherein thou liest in reputation sick; <END>
and thou, too careless patient as thou art, <END>
commit'st thy anointed body to the cure <END>
of those physicians that first wounded thee: <END>
a thousand flatterers sit within thy crown, <END>
whose compass is no bigger than thy head; <END>
and yet, incaged in so small a verge, <END>
the waste is no whit lesser than thy land. <END>
o, had thy grandsire with a prophet's eye <END>
seen how his son's son should destroy his sons, <END>
from forth thy reach he would have laid thy shame, <END>
deposing thee before thou wert possess'd, <END>
which art possess'd now to depose thyself. <END>
why, cousin, wert thou regent of the world, <END>
it were a shame to let this land by lease; <END>
but for thy world enjoying but this land, <END>
is it not more than shame to shame it so? <END>
landlord of england art thou now, not king: <END>
thy state of law is bondslave to the law; and thou-- <END>
a lunatic lean-witted fool, <END>
presuming on an ague's privilege, <END>
darest with thy frozen admonition <END>
make pale our cheek, chasing the royal blood <END>
with fury from his native residence. <END>
now, by my seat's right royal majesty, <END>
wert thou not brother to great edward's son, <END>
this tongue that runs so roundly in thy head <END>
should run thy head from thy unreverent shoulders. <END>
o, spare me not, my brother edward's son, <END>
for that i was his father edward's son; <END>
that blood already, like the pelican, <END>
hast thou tapp'd out and drunkenly caroused: <END>
my brother gloucester, plain well-meaning soul, <END>
whom fair befal in heaven 'mongst happy souls! <END>
may be a precedent and witness good <END>
that thou respect'st not spilling edward's blood: <END>
join with the present sickness that i have; <END>
and thy unkindness be like crooked age, <END>
to crop at once a too long wither'd flower. <END>
live in thy shame, but die not shame with thee! <END>
these words hereafter thy tormentors be! <END>
convey me to my bed, then to my grave: <END>
love they to live that love and honour have. <END>
and let them die that age and sullens have; <END>
for both hast thou, and both become the grave. <END>
i do beseech your majesty, impute his words <END>
to wayward sickliness and age in him: <END>
he loves you, on my life, and holds you dear <END>
as harry duke of hereford, were he here. <END>
right, you say true: as hereford's love, so his; <END>
as theirs, so mine; and all be as it is. <END>
my liege, old gaunt commends him to your majesty. <END>
what says he? <END>
nay, nothing; all is said <END>
his tongue is now a stringless instrument; <END>
words, life and all, old lancaster hath spent. <END>
be york the next that must be bankrupt so! <END>
though death be poor, it ends a mortal woe. <END>
the ripest fruit first falls, and so doth he; <END>
his time is spent, our pilgrimage must be. <END>
so much for that. now for our irish wars: <END>
we must supplant those rough rug-headed kerns, <END>
which live like venom where no venom else <END>
but only they have privilege to live. <END>
and for these great affairs do ask some charge, <END>
towards our assistance we do seize to us <END>
the plate, corn, revenues and moveables, <END>
whereof our uncle gaunt did stand possess'd. <END>
how long shall i be patient? ah, how long <END>
shall tender duty make me suffer wrong? <END>
not gloucester's death, nor hereford's banishment <END>
not gaunt's rebukes, nor england's private wrongs, <END>
nor the prevention of poor bolingbroke <END>
about his marriage, nor my own disgrace, <END>
have ever made me sour my patient cheek, <END>
or bend one wrinkle on my sovereign's face. <END>
i am the last of noble edward's sons, <END>
of whom thy father, prince of wales, was first: <END>
in war was never lion raged more fierce, <END>
in peace was never gentle lamb more mild, <END>
than was that young and princely gentleman. <END>
his face thou hast, for even so look'd he, <END>
accomplish'd with the number of thy hours; <END>
but when he frown'd, it was against the french <END>
and not against his friends; his noble hand <END>
did will what he did spend and spent not that <END>
which his triumphant father's hand had won; <END>
his hands were guilty of no kindred blood, <END>
but bloody with the enemies of his kin. <END>
o richard! york is too far gone with grief, <END>
or else he never would compare between. <END>
why, uncle, what's the matter? <END>
o my liege, <END>
pardon me, if you please; if not, i, pleased <END>
not to be pardon'd, am content withal. <END>
seek you to seize and gripe into your hands <END>
the royalties and rights of banish'd hereford? <END>
is not gaunt dead, and doth not hereford live? <END>
was not gaunt just, and is not harry true? <END>
did not the one deserve to have an heir? <END>
is not his heir a well-deserving son? <END>
take hereford's rights away, and take from time <END>
his charters and his customary rights; <END>
let not to-morrow then ensue to-day; <END>
be not thyself; for how art thou a king <END>
but by fair sequence and succession? <END>
now, afore god--god forbid i say true!-- <END>
if you do wrongfully seize hereford's rights, <END>
call in the letters patent that he hath <END>
by his attorneys-general to sue <END>
his livery, and deny his offer'd homage, <END>
you pluck a thousand dangers on your head, <END>
you lose a thousand well-disposed hearts <END>
and prick my tender patience, to those thoughts <END>
which honour and allegiance cannot think. <END>
think what you will, we seize into our hands <END>
his plate, his goods, his money and his lands. <END>
i'll not be by the while: my liege, farewell: <END>
what will ensue hereof, there's none can tell; <END>
but by bad courses may be understood <END>
that their events can never fall out good. <END>
go, bushy, to the earl of wiltshire straight: <END>
bid him repair to us to ely house <END>
to see this business. to-morrow next <END>
we will for ireland; and 'tis time, i trow: <END>
and we create, in absence of ourself, <END>
our uncle york lord governor of england; <END>
for he is just and always loved us well. <END>
come on, our queen: to-morrow must we part; <END>
be merry, for our time of stay is short <END>
well, lords, the duke of lancaster is dead. <END>
and living too; for now his son is duke. <END>
barely in title, not in revenue. <END>
richly in both, if justice had her right. <END>
my heart is great; but it must break with silence, <END>
ere't be disburden'd with a liberal tongue. <END>
nay, speak thy mind; and let him ne'er speak more <END>
that speaks thy words again to do thee harm! <END>
tends that thou wouldst speak to the duke of hereford? <END>
if it be so, out with it boldly, man; <END>
quick is mine ear to hear of good towards him. <END>
no good at all that i can do for him; <END>
unless you call it good to pity him, <END>
bereft and gelded of his patrimony. <END>
now, afore god, 'tis shame such wrongs are borne <END>
in him, a royal prince, and many moe <END>
of noble blood in this declining land. <END>
the king is not himself, but basely led <END>
by flatterers; and what they will inform, <END>
merely in hate, 'gainst any of us all, <END>
that will the king severely prosecute <END>
'gainst us, our lives, our children, and our heirs. <END>
the commons hath he pill'd with grievous taxes, <END>
and quite lost their hearts: the nobles hath he fined <END>
for ancient quarrels, and quite lost their hearts. <END>
and daily new exactions are devised, <END>
as blanks, benevolences, and i wot not what: <END>
but what, o' god's name, doth become of this? <END>
wars have not wasted it, for warr'd he hath not, <END>
but basely yielded upon compromise <END>
that which his noble ancestors achieved with blows: <END>
more hath he spent in peace than they in wars. <END>
the earl of wiltshire hath the realm in farm. <END>
the king's grown bankrupt, like a broken man. <END>
reproach and dissolution hangeth over him. <END>
he hath not money for these irish wars, <END>
his burthenous taxations notwithstanding, <END>
but by the robbing of the banish'd duke. <END>
his noble kinsman: most degenerate king! <END>
but, lords, we hear this fearful tempest sing, <END>
yet see no shelter to avoid the storm; <END>
we see the wind sit sore upon our sails, <END>
and yet we strike not, but securely perish. <END>
we see the very wreck that we must suffer; <END>
and unavoided is the danger now, <END>
for suffering so the causes of our wreck. <END>
not so; even through the hollow eyes of death <END>
i spy life peering; but i dare not say <END>
how near the tidings of our comfort is. <END>
nay, let us share thy thoughts, as thou dost ours. <END>
be confident to speak, northumberland: <END>
we three are but thyself; and, speaking so, <END>
thy words are but as thoughts; therefore, be bold. <END>
then thus: i have from port le blanc, a bay <END>
in brittany, received intelligence <END>
that harry duke of hereford, rainold lord cobham, <END>
that late broke from the duke of exeter, <END>
his brother, archbishop late of canterbury, <END>
sir thomas erpingham, sir john ramston, <END>
sir john norbery, sir robert waterton and francis quoint, <END>
all these well furnish'd by the duke of bretagne <END>
with eight tall ships, three thousand men of war, <END>
are making hither with all due expedience <END>
and shortly mean to touch our northern shore: <END>
perhaps they had ere this, but that they stay <END>
the first departing of the king for ireland. <END>
if then we shall shake off our slavish yoke, <END>
imp out our drooping country's broken wing, <END>
redeem from broking pawn the blemish'd crown, <END>
wipe off the dust that hides our sceptre's gilt <END>
and make high majesty look like itself, <END>
away with me in post to ravenspurgh; <END>
but if you faint, as fearing to do so, <END>
stay and be secret, and myself will go. <END>
to horse, to horse! urge doubts to them that fear. <END>
hold out my horse, and i will first be there. <END>
madam, your majesty is too much sad: <END>
you promised, when you parted with the king, <END>
to lay aside life-harming heaviness <END>
and entertain a cheerful disposition. <END>
to please the king i did; to please myself <END>
i cannot do it; yet i know no cause <END>
why i should welcome such a guest as grief, <END>
save bidding farewell to so sweet a guest <END>
as my sweet richard: yet again, methinks, <END>
some unborn sorrow, ripe in fortune's womb, <END>
is coming towards me, and my inward soul <END>
with nothing trembles: at some thing it grieves, <END>
more than with parting from my lord the king. <END>
each substance of a grief hath twenty shadows, <END>
which shows like grief itself, but is not so; <END>
for sorrow's eye, glazed with blinding tears, <END>
divides one thing entire to many objects; <END>
like perspectives, which rightly gazed upon <END>
show nothing but confusion, eyed awry <END>
distinguish form: so your sweet majesty, <END>
looking awry upon your lord's departure, <END>
find shapes of grief, more than himself, to wail; <END>
which, look'd on as it is, is nought but shadows <END>
of what it is not. then, thrice-gracious queen, <END>
more than your lord's departure weep not: more's not seen; <END>
or if it be, 'tis with false sorrow's eye, <END>
which for things true weeps things imaginary. <END>
it may be so; but yet my inward soul <END>
persuades me it is otherwise: howe'er it be, <END>
i cannot but be sad; so heavy sad <END>
as, though on thinking on no thought i think, <END>
makes me with heavy nothing faint and shrink. <END>
'tis nothing but conceit, my gracious lady. <END>
'tis nothing less: conceit is still derived <END>
from some forefather grief; mine is not so, <END>
for nothing had begot my something grief; <END>
or something hath the nothing that i grieve: <END>
'tis in reversion that i do possess; <END>
but what it is, that is not yet known; what <END>
i cannot name; 'tis nameless woe, i wot. <END>
god save your majesty! and well met, gentlemen: <END>
i hope the king is not yet shipp'd for ireland. <END>
why hopest thou so? 'tis better hope he is; <END>
for his designs crave haste, his haste good hope: <END>
then wherefore dost thou hope he is not shipp'd? <END>
that he, our hope, might have retired his power, <END>
and driven into despair an enemy's hope, <END>
who strongly hath set footing in this land: <END>
the banish'd bolingbroke repeals himself, <END>
and with uplifted arms is safe arrived <END>
at ravenspurgh. <END>
now god in heaven forbid! <END>
ah, madam, 'tis too true: and that is worse, <END>
the lord northumberland, his son young henry percy, <END>
the lords of ross, beaumond, and willoughby, <END>
with all their powerful friends, are fled to him. <END>
why have you not proclaim'd northumberland <END>
and all the rest revolted faction traitors? <END>
we have: whereupon the earl of worcester <END>
hath broke his staff, resign'd his stewardship, <END>
and all the household servants fled with him <END>
to bolingbroke. <END>
so, green, thou art the midwife to my woe, <END>
and bolingbroke my sorrow's dismal heir: <END>
now hath my soul brought forth her prodigy, <END>
and i, a gasping new-deliver'd mother, <END>
have woe to woe, sorrow to sorrow join'd. <END>
despair not, madam. <END>
who shall hinder me? <END>
i will despair, and be at enmity <END>
with cozening hope: he is a flatterer, <END>
a parasite, a keeper back of death, <END>
who gently would dissolve the bands of life, <END>
which false hope lingers in extremity. <END>
here comes the duke of york. <END>
with signs of war about his aged neck: <END>
o, full of careful business are his looks! <END>
uncle, for god's sake, speak comfortable words. <END>
should i do so, i should belie my thoughts: <END>
comfort's in heaven; and we are on the earth, <END>
where nothing lives but crosses, cares and grief. <END>
your husband, he is gone to save far off, <END>
whilst others come to make him lose at home: <END>
here am i left to underprop his land, <END>
who, weak with age, cannot support myself: <END>
now comes the sick hour that his surfeit made; <END>
now shall he try his friends that flatter'd him. <END>
my lord, your son was gone before i came. <END>
he was? why, so! go all which way it will! <END>
the nobles they are fled, the commons they are cold, <END>
and will, i fear, revolt on hereford's side. <END>
sirrah, get thee to plashy, to my sister gloucester; <END>
bid her send me presently a thousand pound: <END>
hold, take my ring. <END>
my lord, i had forgot to tell your lordship, <END>
to-day, as i came by, i called there; <END>
but i shall grieve you to report the rest. <END>
what is't, knave? <END>
an hour before i came, the duchess died. <END>
god for his mercy! what a tide of woes <END>
comes rushing on this woeful land at once! <END>
i know not what to do: i would to god, <END>
so my untruth had not provoked him to it, <END>
the king had cut off my head with my brother's. <END>
what, are there no posts dispatch'd for ireland? <END>
how shall we do for money for these wars? <END>
come, sister,--cousin, i would say--pray, pardon me. <END>
go, fellow, get thee home, provide some carts <END>
and bring away the armour that is there. <END>
gentlemen, will you go muster men? <END>
if i know how or which way to order these affairs <END>
thus thrust disorderly into my hands, <END>
never believe me. both are my kinsmen: <END>
the one is my sovereign, whom both my oath <END>
and duty bids defend; the other again <END>
is my kinsman, whom the king hath wrong'd, <END>
whom conscience and my kindred bids to right. <END>
well, somewhat we must do. come, cousin, i'll <END>
dispose of you. <END>
gentlemen, go, muster up your men, <END>
and meet me presently at berkeley. <END>
i should to plashy too; <END>
but time will not permit: all is uneven, <END>
and every thing is left at six and seven. <END>
the wind sits fair for news to go to ireland, <END>
but none returns. for us to levy power <END>
proportionable to the enemy <END>
is all unpossible. <END>
besides, our nearness to the king in love <END>
is near the hate of those love not the king. <END>
and that's the wavering commons: for their love <END>
lies in their purses, and whoso empties them <END>
by so much fills their hearts with deadly hate. <END>
wherein the king stands generally condemn'd. <END>
if judgement lie in them, then so do we, <END>
because we ever have been near the king. <END>
well, i will for refuge straight to bristol castle: <END>
the earl of wiltshire is already there. <END>
thither will i with you; for little office <END>
the hateful commons will perform for us, <END>
except like curs to tear us all to pieces. <END>
will you go along with us? <END>
no; i will to ireland to his majesty. <END>
we three here art that ne'er shall meet again. <END>
that's as york thrives to beat back bolingbroke. <END>
alas, poor duke! the task he undertakes <END>
is numbering sands and drinking oceans dry: <END>
where one on his side fights, thousands will fly. <END>
farewell at once, for once, for all, and ever. <END>
well, we may meet again. <END>
i fear me, never. <END>
how far is it, my lord, to berkeley now? <END>
believe me, noble lord, <END>
i am a stranger here in gloucestershire: <END>
these high wild hills and rough uneven ways <END>
draws out our miles, and makes them wearisome, <END>
and yet your fair discourse hath been as sugar, <END>
making the hard way sweet and delectable. <END>
but i bethink me what a weary way <END>
from ravenspurgh to cotswold will be found <END>
in ross and willoughby, wanting your company, <END>
which, i protest, hath very much beguiled <END>
the tediousness and process of my travel: <END>
but theirs is sweetened with the hope to have <END>
the present benefit which i possess; <END>
and hope to joy is little less in joy <END>
than hope enjoy'd: by this the weary lords <END>
shall make their way seem short, as mine hath done <END>
by sight of what i have, your noble company. <END>
of much less value is my company <END>
than your good words. but who comes here? <END>
it is my son, young harry percy, <END>
sent from my brother worcester, whencesoever. <END>
harry, how fares your uncle? <END>
i had thought, my lord, to have learn'd his health of you. <END>
why, is he not with the queen? <END>
no, my good lord; he hath forsook the court, <END>
broken his staff of office and dispersed <END>
the household of the king. <END>
what was his reason? <END>
he was not so resolved when last we spake together. <END>
because your lordship was proclaimed traitor. <END>
but he, my lord, is gone to ravenspurgh, <END>
to offer service to the duke of hereford, <END>
and sent me over by berkeley, to discover <END>
what power the duke of york had levied there; <END>
then with directions to repair to ravenspurgh. <END>
have you forgot the duke of hereford, boy? <END>
no, my good lord, for that is not forgot <END>
which ne'er i did remember: to my knowledge, <END>
i never in my life did look on him. <END>
then learn to know him now; this is the duke. <END>
my gracious lord, i tender you my service, <END>
such as it is, being tender, raw and young: <END>
which elder days shall ripen and confirm <END>
to more approved service and desert. <END>
i thank thee, gentle percy; and be sure <END>
i count myself in nothing else so happy <END>
as in a soul remembering my good friends; <END>
and, as my fortune ripens with thy love, <END>
it shall be still thy true love's recompense: <END>
my heart this covenant makes, my hand thus seals it. <END>
how far is it to berkeley? and what stir <END>
keeps good old york there with his men of war? <END>
there stands the castle, by yon tuft of trees, <END>
mann'd with three hundred men, as i have heard; <END>
and in it are the lords of york, berkeley, and seymour; <END>
none else of name and noble estimate. <END>
here come the lords of ross and willoughby, <END>
bloody with spurring, fiery-red with haste. <END>
welcome, my lords. i wot your love pursues <END>
a banish'd traitor: all my treasury <END>
is yet but unfelt thanks, which more enrich'd <END>
shall be your love and labour's recompense. <END>
your presence makes us rich, most noble lord. <END>
and far surmounts our labour to attain it. <END>
evermore thanks, the exchequer of the poor; <END>
which, till my infant fortune comes to years, <END>
stands for my bounty. but who comes here? <END>
it is my lord of berkeley, as i guess. <END>
my lord of hereford, my message is to you. <END>
my lord, my answer is--to lancaster; <END>
and i am come to seek that name in england; <END>
and i must find that title in your tongue, <END>
before i make reply to aught you say. <END>
mistake me not, my lord; 'tis not my meaning <END>
to raze one title of your honour out: <END>
to you, my lord, i come, what lord you will, <END>
from the most gracious regent of this land, <END>
the duke of york, to know what pricks you on <END>
to take advantage of the absent time <END>
and fright our native peace with self-born arms. <END>
i shall not need transport my words by you; <END>
here comes his grace in person. my noble uncle! <END>
show me thy humble heart, and not thy knee, <END>
whose duty is deceiveable and false. <END>
my gracious uncle-- <END>
tut, tut! <END>
grace me no grace, nor uncle me no uncle: <END>
i am no traitor's uncle; and that word 'grace.' <END>
in an ungracious mouth is but profane. <END>
why have those banish'd and forbidden legs <END>
dared once to touch a dust of england's ground? <END>
but then more 'why?' why have they dared to march <END>
so many miles upon her peaceful bosom, <END>
frighting her pale-faced villages with war <END>
and ostentation of despised arms? <END>
comest thou because the anointed king is hence? <END>
why, foolish boy, the king is left behind, <END>
and in my loyal bosom lies his power. <END>
were i but now the lord of such hot youth <END>
as when brave gaunt, thy father, and myself <END>
rescued the black prince, that young mars of men, <END>
from forth the ranks of many thousand french, <END>
o, then how quickly should this arm of mine. <END>
now prisoner to the palsy, chastise thee <END>
and minister correction to thy fault! <END>
my gracious uncle, let me know my fault: <END>
on what condition stands it and wherein? <END>
even in condition of the worst degree, <END>
in gross rebellion and detested treason: <END>
thou art a banish'd man, and here art come <END>
before the expiration of thy time, <END>
in braving arms against thy sovereign. <END>
as i was banish'd, i was banish'd hereford; <END>
but as i come, i come for lancaster. <END>
and, noble uncle, i beseech your grace <END>
look on my wrongs with an indifferent eye: <END>
you are my father, for methinks in you <END>
i see old gaunt alive; o, then, my father, <END>
will you permit that i shall stand condemn'd <END>
a wandering vagabond; my rights and royalties <END>
pluck'd from my arms perforce and given away <END>
to upstart unthrifts? wherefore was i born? <END>
if that my cousin king be king of england, <END>
it must be granted i am duke of lancaster. <END>
you have a son, aumerle, my noble cousin; <END>
had you first died, and he been thus trod down, <END>
he should have found his uncle gaunt a father, <END>
to rouse his wrongs and chase them to the bay. <END>
i am denied to sue my livery here, <END>
and yet my letters-patents give me leave: <END>
my father's goods are all distrain'd and sold, <END>
and these and all are all amiss employ'd. <END>
what would you have me do? i am a subject, <END>
and i challenge law: attorneys are denied me; <END>
and therefore, personally i lay my claim <END>
to my inheritance of free descent. <END>
the noble duke hath been too much abused. <END>
it stands your grace upon to do him right. <END>
base men by his endowments are made great. <END>
my lords of england, let me tell you this: <END>
i have had feeling of my cousin's wrongs <END>
and laboured all i could to do him right; <END>
but in this kind to come, in braving arms, <END>
be his own carver and cut out his way, <END>
to find out right with wrong, it may not be; <END>
and you that do abet him in this kind <END>
cherish rebellion and are rebels all. <END>
the noble duke hath sworn his coming is <END>
but for his own; and for the right of that <END>
we all have strongly sworn to give him aid; <END>
and let him ne'er see joy that breaks that oath! <END>
well, well, i see the issue of these arms: <END>
i cannot mend it, i must needs confess, <END>
because my power is weak and all ill left: <END>
but if i could, by him that gave me life, <END>
i would attach you all and make you stoop <END>
unto the sovereign mercy of the king; <END>
but since i cannot, be it known to you <END>
i do remain as neuter. so, fare you well; <END>
unless you please to enter in the castle <END>
and there repose you for this night. <END>
an offer, uncle, that we will accept: <END>
but we must win your grace to go with us <END>
to bristol castle, which they say is held <END>
by bushy, bagot and their complices, <END>
the caterpillars of the commonwealth, <END>
which i have sworn to weed and pluck away. <END>
it may be i will go with you: but yet i'll pause; <END>
for i am loath to break our country's laws. <END>
nor friends nor foes, to me welcome you are: <END>
things past redress are now with me past care. <END>
my lord of salisbury, we have stay'd ten days, <END>
and hardly kept our countrymen together, <END>
and yet we hear no tidings from the king; <END>
therefore we will disperse ourselves: farewell. <END>
stay yet another day, thou trusty welshman: <END>
the king reposeth all his confidence in thee. <END>
'tis thought the king is dead; we will not stay. <END>
the bay-trees in our country are all wither'd <END>
and meteors fright the fixed stars of heaven; <END>
the pale-faced moon looks bloody on the earth <END>
and lean-look'd prophets whisper fearful change; <END>
rich men look sad and ruffians dance and leap, <END>
the one in fear to lose what they enjoy, <END>
the other to enjoy by rage and war: <END>
these signs forerun the death or fall of kings. <END>
as well assured richard their king is dead. <END>
ah, richard, with the eyes of heavy mind <END>
i see thy glory like a shooting star <END>
fall to the base earth from the firmament. <END>
thy sun sets weeping in the lowly west, <END>
witnessing storms to come, woe and unrest: <END>
thy friends are fled to wait upon thy foes, <END>
and crossly to thy good all fortune goes. <END>
bring forth these men. <END>
bushy and green, i will not vex your souls-- <END>
since presently your souls must part your bodies-- <END>
with too much urging your pernicious lives, <END>
for 'twere no charity; yet, to wash your blood <END>
from off my hands, here in the view of men <END>
i will unfold some causes of your deaths. <END>
you have misled a prince, a royal king, <END>
a happy gentleman in blood and lineaments, <END>
by you unhappied and disfigured clean: <END>
you have in manner with your sinful hours <END>
made a divorce betwixt his queen and him, <END>
broke the possession of a royal bed <END>
and stain'd the beauty of a fair queen's cheeks <END>
with tears drawn from her eyes by your foul wrongs. <END>
myself, a prince by fortune of my birth, <END>
near to the king in blood, and near in love <END>
till you did make him misinterpret me, <END>
have stoop'd my neck under your injuries, <END>
and sigh'd my english breath in foreign clouds, <END>
eating the bitter bread of banishment; <END>
whilst you have fed upon my signories, <END>
dispark'd my parks and fell'd my forest woods, <END>
from my own windows torn my household coat, <END>
razed out my imprese, leaving me no sign, <END>
save men's opinions and my living blood, <END>
to show the world i am a gentleman. <END>
this and much more, much more than twice all this, <END>
condemns you to the death. see them deliver'd over <END>
to execution and the hand of death. <END>
more welcome is the stroke of death to me <END>
than bolingbroke to england. lords, farewell. <END>
my comfort is that heaven will take our souls <END>
and plague injustice with the pains of hell. <END>
my lord northumberland, see them dispatch'd. <END>
uncle, you say the queen is at your house; <END>
for god's sake, fairly let her be entreated: <END>
tell her i send to her my kind commends; <END>
take special care my greetings be deliver'd. <END>
a gentleman of mine i have dispatch'd <END>
with letters of your love to her at large. <END>
thank, gentle uncle. come, lords, away. <END>
to fight with glendower and his complices: <END>
awhile to work, and after holiday. <END>
barkloughly castle call they this at hand? <END>
yea, my lord. how brooks your grace the air, <END>
after your late tossing on the breaking seas? <END>
needs must i like it well: i weep for joy <END>
to stand upon my kingdom once again. <END>
dear earth, i do salute thee with my hand, <END>
though rebels wound thee with their horses' hoofs: <END>
as a long-parted mother with her child <END>
plays fondly with her tears and smiles in meeting, <END>
so, weeping, smiling, greet i thee, my earth, <END>
and do thee favours with my royal hands. <END>
feed not thy sovereign's foe, my gentle earth, <END>
nor with thy sweets comfort his ravenous sense; <END>
but let thy spiders, that suck up thy venom, <END>
and heavy-gaited toads lie in their way, <END>
doing annoyance to the treacherous feet <END>
which with usurping steps do trample thee: <END>
yield stinging nettles to mine enemies; <END>
and when they from thy bosom pluck a flower, <END>
guard it, i pray thee, with a lurking adder <END>
whose double tongue may with a mortal touch <END>
throw death upon thy sovereign's enemies. <END>
mock not my senseless conjuration, lords: <END>
this earth shall have a feeling and these stones <END>
prove armed soldiers, ere her native king <END>
shall falter under foul rebellion's arms. <END>
fear not, my lord: that power that made you king <END>
hath power to keep you king in spite of all. <END>
the means that heaven yields must be embraced, <END>
and not neglected; else, if heaven would, <END>
and we will not, heaven's offer we refuse, <END>
the proffer'd means of succor and redress. <END>
he means, my lord, that we are too remiss; <END>
whilst bolingbroke, through our security, <END>
grows strong and great in substance and in power. <END>
discomfortable cousin! know'st thou not <END>
that when the searching eye of heaven is hid, <END>
behind the globe, that lights the lower world, <END>
then thieves and robbers range abroad unseen <END>
in murders and in outrage, boldly here; <END>
but when from under this terrestrial ball <END>
he fires the proud tops of the eastern pines <END>
and darts his light through every guilty hole, <END>
then murders, treasons and detested sins, <END>
the cloak of night being pluck'd from off their backs, <END>
stand bare and naked, trembling at themselves? <END>
so when this thief, this traitor, bolingbroke, <END>
who all this while hath revell'd in the night <END>
whilst we were wandering with the antipodes, <END>
shall see us rising in our throne, the east, <END>
his treasons will sit blushing in his face, <END>
not able to endure the sight of day, <END>
but self-affrighted tremble at his sin. <END>
not all the water in the rough rude sea <END>
can wash the balm off from an anointed king; <END>
the breath of worldly men cannot depose <END>
the deputy elected by the lord: <END>
for every man that bolingbroke hath press'd <END>
to lift shrewd steel against our golden crown, <END>
god for his richard hath in heavenly pay <END>
a glorious angel: then, if angels fight, <END>
weak men must fall, for heaven still guards the right. <END>
welcome, my lord how far off lies your power? <END>
nor near nor farther off, my gracious lord, <END>
than this weak arm: discomfort guides my tongue <END>
and bids me speak of nothing but despair. <END>
one day too late, i fear me, noble lord, <END>
hath clouded all thy happy days on earth: <END>
o, call back yesterday, bid time return, <END>
and thou shalt have twelve thousand fighting men! <END>
to-day, to-day, unhappy day, too late, <END>
o'erthrows thy joys, friends, fortune and thy state: <END>
for all the welshmen, hearing thou wert dead. <END>
are gone to bolingbroke, dispersed and fled. <END>
comfort, my liege; why looks your grace so pale? <END>
but now the blood of twenty thousand men <END>
did triumph in my face, and they are fled; <END>
and, till so much blood thither come again, <END>
have i not reason to look pale and dead? <END>
all souls that will be safe fly from my side, <END>
for time hath set a blot upon my pride. <END>
comfort, my liege; remember who you are. <END>
i had forgot myself; am i not king? <END>
awake, thou coward majesty! thou sleepest. <END>
is not the king's name twenty thousand names? <END>
arm, arm, my name! a puny subject strikes <END>
at thy great glory. look not to the ground, <END>
ye favourites of a king: are we not high? <END>
high be our thoughts: i know my uncle york <END>
hath power enough to serve our turn. but who comes here? <END>
more health and happiness betide my liege <END>
than can my care-tuned tongue deliver him! <END>
mine ear is open and my heart prepared; <END>
the worst is worldly loss thou canst unfold. <END>
say, is my kingdom lost? why, 'twas my care <END>
and what loss is it to be rid of care? <END>
strives bolingbroke to be as great as we? <END>
greater he shall not be; if he serve god, <END>
we'll serve him too and be his fellow so: <END>
revolt our subjects? that we cannot mend; <END>
they break their faith to god as well as us: <END>
cry woe, destruction, ruin and decay: <END>
the worst is death, and death will have his day. <END>
glad am i that your highness is so arm'd <END>
to bear the tidings of calamity. <END>
like an unseasonable stormy day, <END>
which makes the silver rivers drown their shores, <END>
as if the world were all dissolved to tears, <END>
so high above his limits swells the rage <END>
of bolingbroke, covering your fearful land <END>
with hard bright steel and hearts harder than steel. <END>
white-beards have arm'd their thin and hairless scalps <END>
against thy majesty; boys, with women's voices, <END>
strive to speak big and clap their female joints <END>
in stiff unwieldy arms against thy crown: <END>
the very beadsmen learn to bend their bows <END>
of double-fatal yew against thy state; <END>
yea, distaff-women manage rusty bills <END>
against thy seat: both young and old rebel, <END>
and all goes worse than i have power to tell. <END>
too well, too well thou tell'st a tale so ill. <END>
where is the earl of wiltshire? where is bagot? <END>
what is become of bushy? where is green? <END>
that they have let the dangerous enemy <END>
measure our confines with such peaceful steps? <END>
if we prevail, their heads shall pay for it: <END>
i warrant they have made peace with bolingbroke. <END>
peace have they made with him indeed, my lord. <END>
o villains, vipers, damn'd without redemption! <END>
dogs, easily won to fawn on any man! <END>
snakes, in my heart-blood warm'd, that sting my heart! <END>
three judases, each one thrice worse than judas! <END>
would they make peace? terrible hell make war <END>
upon their spotted souls for this offence! <END>
sweet love, i see, changing his property, <END>
turns to the sourest and most deadly hate: <END>
again uncurse their souls; their peace is made <END>
with heads, and not with hands; those whom you curse <END>
have felt the worst of death's destroying wound <END>
and lie full low, graved in the hollow ground. <END>
is bushy, green, and the earl of wiltshire dead? <END>
ay, all of them at bristol lost their heads. <END>
where is the duke my father with his power? <END>
no matter where; of comfort no man speak: <END>
let's talk of graves, of worms, and epitaphs; <END>
make dust our paper and with rainy eyes <END>
write sorrow on the bosom of the earth, <END>
let's choose executors and talk of wills: <END>
and yet not so, for what can we bequeath <END>
save our deposed bodies to the ground? <END>
our lands, our lives and all are bolingbroke's, <END>
and nothing can we call our own but death <END>
and that small model of the barren earth <END>
which serves as paste and cover to our bones. <END>
for god's sake, let us sit upon the ground <END>
and tell sad stories of the death of kings; <END>
how some have been deposed; some slain in war, <END>
some haunted by the ghosts they have deposed; <END>
some poison'd by their wives: some sleeping kill'd; <END>
all murder'd: for within the hollow crown <END>
that rounds the mortal temples of a king <END>
keeps death his court and there the antic sits, <END>
scoffing his state and grinning at his pomp, <END>
allowing him a breath, a little scene, <END>
to monarchize, be fear'd and kill with looks, <END>
infusing him with self and vain conceit, <END>
as if this flesh which walls about our life, <END>
were brass impregnable, and humour'd thus <END>
comes at the last and with a little pin <END>
bores through his castle wall, and farewell king! <END>
cover your heads and mock not flesh and blood <END>
with solemn reverence: throw away respect, <END>
tradition, form and ceremonious duty, <END>
for you have but mistook me all this while: <END>
i live with bread like you, feel want, <END>
taste grief, need friends: subjected thus, <END>
how can you say to me, i am a king? <END>
my lord, wise men ne'er sit and wail their woes, <END>
but presently prevent the ways to wail. <END>
to fear the foe, since fear oppresseth strength, <END>
gives in your weakness strength unto your foe, <END>
and so your follies fight against yourself. <END>
fear and be slain; no worse can come to fight: <END>
and fight and die is death destroying death; <END>
where fearing dying pays death servile breath. <END>
my father hath a power; inquire of him <END>
and learn to make a body of a limb. <END>
thou chidest me well: proud bolingbroke, i come <END>
to change blows with thee for our day of doom. <END>
this ague fit of fear is over-blown; <END>
an easy task it is to win our own. <END>
say, scroop, where lies our uncle with his power? <END>
speak sweetly, man, although thy looks be sour. <END>
men judge by the complexion of the sky <END>
the state and inclination of the day: <END>
so may you by my dull and heavy eye, <END>
my tongue hath but a heavier tale to say. <END>
i play the torturer, by small and small <END>
to lengthen out the worst that must be spoken: <END>
your uncle york is join'd with bolingbroke, <END>
and all your northern castles yielded up, <END>
and all your southern gentlemen in arms <END>
upon his party. <END>
thou hast said enough. <END>
beshrew thee, cousin, which didst lead me forth <END>
of that sweet way i was in to despair! <END>
what say you now? what comfort have we now? <END>
by heaven, i'll hate him everlastingly <END>
that bids me be of comfort any more. <END>
go to flint castle: there i'll pine away; <END>
a king, woe's slave, shall kingly woe obey. <END>
that power i have, discharge; and let them go <END>
to ear the land that hath some hope to grow, <END>
for i have none: let no man speak again <END>
to alter this, for counsel is but vain. <END>
my liege, one word. <END>
he does me double wrong <END>
that wounds me with the flatteries of his tongue. <END>
discharge my followers: let them hence away, <END>
from richard's night to bolingbroke's fair day. <END>
so that by this intelligence we learn <END>
the welshmen are dispersed, and salisbury <END>
is gone to meet the king, who lately landed <END>
with some few private friends upon this coast. <END>
the news is very fair and good, my lord: <END>
richard not far from hence hath hid his head. <END>
it would beseem the lord northumberland <END>
to say 'king richard:' alack the heavy day <END>
when such a sacred king should hide his head. <END>
your grace mistakes; only to be brief <END>
left i his title out. <END>
the time hath been, <END>
would you have been so brief with him, he would <END>
have been so brief with you, to shorten you, <END>
for taking so the head, your whole head's length. <END>
mistake not, uncle, further than you should. <END>
take not, good cousin, further than you should. <END>
lest you mistake the heavens are o'er our heads. <END>
i know it, uncle, and oppose not myself <END>
against their will. but who comes here? <END>
welcome, harry: what, will not this castle yield? <END>
the castle royally is mann'd, my lord, <END>
against thy entrance. <END>
royally! <END>
why, it contains no king? <END>
yes, my good lord, <END>
it doth contain a king; king richard lies <END>
within the limits of yon lime and stone: <END>
and with him are the lord aumerle, lord salisbury, <END>
sir stephen scroop, besides a clergyman <END>
of holy reverence; who, i cannot learn. <END>
o, belike it is the bishop of carlisle. <END>
noble lords, <END>
go to the rude ribs of that ancient castle; <END>
through brazen trumpet send the breath of parley <END>
into his ruin'd ears, and thus deliver: <END>
henry bolingbroke <END>
on both his knees doth kiss king richard's hand <END>
and sends allegiance and true faith of heart <END>
to his most royal person, hither come <END>
even at his feet to lay my arms and power, <END>
provided that my banishment repeal'd <END>
and lands restored again be freely granted: <END>
if not, i'll use the advantage of my power <END>
and lay the summer's dust with showers of blood <END>
rain'd from the wounds of slaughter'd englishmen: <END>
the which, how far off from the mind of bolingbroke <END>
it is, such crimson tempest should bedrench <END>
the fresh green lap of fair king richard's land, <END>
my stooping duty tenderly shall show. <END>
go, signify as much, while here we march <END>
upon the grassy carpet of this plain. <END>
let's march without the noise of threatening drum, <END>
that from this castle's tatter'd battlements <END>
our fair appointments may be well perused. <END>
methinks king richard and myself should meet <END>
with no less terror than the elements <END>
of fire and water, when their thundering shock <END>
at meeting tears the cloudy cheeks of heaven. <END>
be he the fire, i'll be the yielding water: <END>
the rage be his, whilst on the earth i rain <END>
my waters; on the earth, and not on him. <END>
march on, and mark king richard how he looks. <END>
see, see, king richard doth himself appear, <END>
as doth the blushing discontented sun <END>
from out the fiery portal of the east, <END>
when he perceives the envious clouds are bent <END>
to dim his glory and to stain the track <END>
of his bright passage to the occident. <END>
yet looks he like a king: behold, his eye, <END>
as bright as is the eagle's, lightens forth <END>
controlling majesty: alack, alack, for woe, <END>
that any harm should stain so fair a show! <END>
we are amazed; and thus long have we stood <END>
to watch the fearful bending of thy knee, <END>
because we thought ourself thy lawful king: <END>
and if we be, how dare thy joints forget <END>
to pay their awful duty to our presence? <END>
if we be not, show us the hand of god <END>
that hath dismissed us from our stewardship; <END>
for well we know, no hand of blood and bone <END>
can gripe the sacred handle of our sceptre, <END>
unless he do profane, steal, or usurp. <END>
and though you think that all, as you have done, <END>
have torn their souls by turning them from us, <END>
and we are barren and bereft of friends; <END>
yet know, my master, god omnipotent, <END>
is mustering in his clouds on our behalf <END>
armies of pestilence; and they shall strike <END>
your children yet unborn and unbegot, <END>
that lift your vassal hands against my head <END>
and threat the glory of my precious crown. <END>
tell bolingbroke--for yond methinks he stands-- <END>
that every stride he makes upon my land <END>
is dangerous treason: he is come to open <END>
the purple testament of bleeding war; <END>
but ere the crown he looks for live in peace, <END>
ten thousand bloody crowns of mothers' sons <END>
shall ill become the flower of england's face, <END>
change the complexion of her maid-pale peace <END>
to scarlet indignation and bedew <END>
her pastures' grass with faithful english blood. <END>
the king of heaven forbid our lord the king <END>
should so with civil and uncivil arms <END>
be rush'd upon! thy thrice noble cousin <END>
harry bolingbroke doth humbly kiss thy hand; <END>
and by the honourable tomb he swears, <END>
that stands upon your royal grandsire's bones, <END>
and by the royalties of both your bloods, <END>
currents that spring from one most gracious head, <END>
and by the buried hand of warlike gaunt, <END>
and by the worth and honour of himself, <END>
comprising all that may be sworn or said, <END>
his coming hither hath no further scope <END>
than for his lineal royalties and to beg <END>
enfranchisement immediate on his knees: <END>
which on thy royal party granted once, <END>
his glittering arms he will commend to rust, <END>
his barbed steeds to stables, and his heart <END>
to faithful service of your majesty. <END>
this swears he, as he is a prince, is just; <END>
and, as i am a gentleman, i credit him. <END>
northumberland, say thus the king returns: <END>
his noble cousin is right welcome hither; <END>
and all the number of his fair demands <END>
shall be accomplish'd without contradiction: <END>
with all the gracious utterance thou hast <END>
speak to his gentle hearing kind commends. <END>
we do debase ourselves, cousin, do we not, <END>
to look so poorly and to speak so fair? <END>
shall we call back northumberland, and send <END>
defiance to the traitor, and so die? <END>
no, good my lord; let's fight with gentle words <END>
till time lend friends and friends their helpful swords. <END>
o god, o god! that e'er this tongue of mine, <END>
that laid the sentence of dread banishment <END>
on yon proud man, should take it off again <END>
with words of sooth! o that i were as great <END>
as is my grief, or lesser than my name! <END>
or that i could forget what i have been, <END>
or not remember what i must be now! <END>
swell'st thou, proud heart? i'll give thee scope to beat, <END>
since foes have scope to beat both thee and me. <END>
northumberland comes back from bolingbroke. <END>
what must the king do now? must he submit? <END>
the king shall do it: must he be deposed? <END>
the king shall be contented: must he lose <END>
the name of king? o' god's name, let it go: <END>
i'll give my jewels for a set of beads, <END>
my gorgeous palace for a hermitage, <END>
my gay apparel for an almsman's gown, <END>
my figured goblets for a dish of wood, <END>
my sceptre for a palmer's walking staff, <END>
my subjects for a pair of carved saints <END>
and my large kingdom for a little grave, <END>
a little little grave, an obscure grave; <END>
or i'll be buried in the king's highway, <END>
some way of common trade, where subjects' feet <END>
may hourly trample on their sovereign's head; <END>
for on my heart they tread now whilst i live; <END>
and buried once, why not upon my head? <END>
aumerle, thou weep'st, my tender-hearted cousin! <END>
we'll make foul weather with despised tears; <END>
our sighs and they shall lodge the summer corn, <END>
and make a dearth in this revolting land. <END>
or shall we play the wantons with our woes, <END>
and make some pretty match with shedding tears? <END>
as thus, to drop them still upon one place, <END>
till they have fretted us a pair of graves <END>
within the earth; and, therein laid,--there lies <END>
two kinsmen digg'd their graves with weeping eyes. <END>
would not this ill do well? well, well, i see <END>
i talk but idly, and you laugh at me. <END>
most mighty prince, my lord northumberland, <END>
what says king bolingbroke? will his majesty <END>
give richard leave to live till richard die? <END>
you make a leg, and bolingbroke says ay. <END>
my lord, in the base court he doth attend <END>
to speak with you; may it please you to come down. <END>
down, down i come; like glistering phaethon, <END>
wanting the manage of unruly jades. <END>
in the base court? base court, where kings grow base, <END>
to come at traitors' calls and do them grace. <END>
in the base court? come down? down, court! <END>
down, king! <END>
for night-owls shriek where mounting larks <END>
should sing. <END>
what says his majesty? <END>
sorrow and grief of heart <END>
makes him speak fondly, like a frantic man <END>
yet he is come. <END>
stand all apart, <END>
and show fair duty to his majesty. <END>
my gracious lord,-- <END>
fair cousin, you debase your princely knee <END>
to make the base earth proud with kissing it: <END>
me rather had my heart might feel your love <END>
than my unpleased eye see your courtesy. <END>
up, cousin, up; your heart is up, i know, <END>
thus high at least, although your knee be low. <END>
my gracious lord, i come but for mine own. <END>
your own is yours, and i am yours, and all. <END>
so far be mine, my most redoubted lord, <END>
as my true service shall deserve your love. <END>
well you deserve: they well deserve to have, <END>
that know the strong'st and surest way to get. <END>
uncle, give me your hands: nay, dry your eyes; <END>
tears show their love, but want their remedies. <END>
cousin, i am too young to be your father, <END>
though you are old enough to be my heir. <END>
what you will have, i'll give, and willing too; <END>
for do we must what force will have us do. <END>
set on towards london, cousin, is it so? <END>
yea, my good lord. <END>
then i must not say no. <END>
what sport shall we devise here in this garden, <END>
to drive away the heavy thought of care? <END>
madam, we'll play at bowls. <END>
'twill make me think the world is full of rubs, <END>
and that my fortune rubs against the bias. <END>
madam, we'll dance. <END>
my legs can keep no measure in delight, <END>
when my poor heart no measure keeps in grief: <END>
therefore, no dancing, girl; some other sport. <END>
madam, we'll tell tales. <END>
of sorrow or of joy? <END>
of either, madam. <END>
of neither, girl: <END>
for of joy, being altogether wanting, <END>
it doth remember me the more of sorrow; <END>
or if of grief, being altogether had, <END>
it adds more sorrow to my want of joy: <END>
for what i have i need not to repeat; <END>
and what i want it boots not to complain. <END>
madam, i'll sing. <END>
'tis well that thou hast cause <END>
but thou shouldst please me better, wouldst thou weep. <END>
i could weep, madam, would it do you good. <END>
and i could sing, would weeping do me good, <END>
and never borrow any tear of thee. <END>
but stay, here come the gardeners: <END>
let's step into the shadow of these trees. <END>
my wretchedness unto a row of pins, <END>
they'll talk of state; for every one doth so <END>
against a change; woe is forerun with woe. <END>
go, bind thou up yon dangling apricocks, <END>
which, like unruly children, make their sire <END>
stoop with oppression of their prodigal weight: <END>
give some supportance to the bending twigs. <END>
go thou, and like an executioner, <END>
cut off the heads of too fast growing sprays, <END>
that look too lofty in our commonwealth: <END>
all must be even in our government. <END>
you thus employ'd, i will go root away <END>
the noisome weeds, which without profit suck <END>
the soil's fertility from wholesome flowers. <END>
why should we in the compass of a pale <END>
keep law and form and due proportion, <END>
showing, as in a model, our firm estate, <END>
when our sea-walled garden, the whole land, <END>
is full of weeds, her fairest flowers choked up, <END>
her fruit-trees all upturned, her hedges ruin'd, <END>
her knots disorder'd and her wholesome herbs <END>
swarming with caterpillars? <END>
hold thy peace: <END>
he that hath suffer'd this disorder'd spring <END>
hath now himself met with the fall of leaf: <END>
the weeds which his broad-spreading leaves did shelter, <END>
that seem'd in eating him to hold him up, <END>
are pluck'd up root and all by bolingbroke, <END>
i mean the earl of wiltshire, bushy, green. <END>
what, are they dead? <END>
they are; and bolingbroke <END>
hath seized the wasteful king. o, what pity is it <END>
that he had not so trimm'd and dress'd his land <END>
as we this garden! we at time of year <END>
do wound the bark, the skin of our fruit-trees, <END>
lest, being over-proud in sap and blood, <END>
with too much riches it confound itself: <END>
had he done so to great and growing men, <END>
they might have lived to bear and he to taste <END>
their fruits of duty: superfluous branches <END>
we lop away, that bearing boughs may live: <END>
had he done so, himself had borne the crown, <END>
which waste of idle hours hath quite thrown down. <END>
what, think you then the king shall be deposed? <END>
depress'd he is already, and deposed <END>
'tis doubt he will be: letters came last night <END>
to a dear friend of the good duke of york's, <END>
that tell black tidings. <END>
o, i am press'd to death through want of speaking! <END>
thou, old adam's likeness, set to dress this garden, <END>
how dares thy harsh rude tongue sound this unpleasing news? <END>
what eve, what serpent, hath suggested thee <END>
to make a second fall of cursed man? <END>
why dost thou say king richard is deposed? <END>
darest thou, thou little better thing than earth, <END>
divine his downfall? say, where, when, and how, <END>
camest thou by this ill tidings? speak, thou wretch. <END>
pardon me, madam: little joy have i <END>
to breathe this news; yet what i say is true. <END>
king richard, he is in the mighty hold <END>
in your lord's scale is nothing but himself, <END>
and some few vanities that make him light; <END>
but in the balance of great bolingbroke, <END>
besides himself, are all the english peers, <END>
and with that odds he weighs king richard down. <END>
post you to london, and you will find it so; <END>
i speak no more than every one doth know. <END>
nimble mischance, that art so light of foot, <END>
doth not thy embassage belong to me, <END>
and am i last that knows it? o, thou think'st <END>
to serve me last, that i may longest keep <END>
thy sorrow in my breast. come, ladies, go, <END>
to meet at london london's king in woe. <END>
what, was i born to this, that my sad look <END>
should grace the triumph of great bolingbroke? <END>
gardener, for telling me these news of woe, <END>
pray god the plants thou graft'st may never grow. <END>
poor queen! so that thy state might be no worse, <END>
i would my skill were subject to thy curse. <END>
here did she fall a tear; here in this place <END>
i'll set a bank of rue, sour herb of grace: <END>
rue, even for ruth, here shortly shall be seen, <END>
in the remembrance of a weeping queen. <END>
call forth bagot. <END>
now, bagot, freely speak thy mind; <END>
what thou dost know of noble gloucester's death, <END>
who wrought it with the king, and who perform'd <END>
the bloody office of his timeless end. <END>
then set before my face the lord aumerle. <END>
cousin, stand forth, and look upon that man. <END>
my lord aumerle, i know your daring tongue <END>
scorns to unsay what once it hath deliver'd. <END>
in that dead time when gloucester's death was plotted, <END>
i heard you say, 'is not my arm of length, <END>
that reacheth from the restful english court <END>
as far as calais, to mine uncle's head?' <END>
amongst much other talk, that very time, <END>
i heard you say that you had rather refuse <END>
the offer of an hundred thousand crowns <END>
than bolingbroke's return to england; <END>
adding withal how blest this land would be <END>
in this your cousin's death. <END>
princes and noble lords, <END>
what answer shall i make to this base man? <END>
shall i so much dishonour my fair stars, <END>
on equal terms to give him chastisement? <END>
either i must, or have mine honour soil'd <END>
with the attainder of his slanderous lips. <END>
there is my gage, the manual seal of death, <END>
that marks thee out for hell: i say, thou liest, <END>
and will maintain what thou hast said is false <END>
in thy heart-blood, though being all too base <END>
to stain the temper of my knightly sword. <END>
bagot, forbear; thou shalt not take it up. <END>
excepting one, i would he were the best <END>
in all this presence that hath moved me so. <END>
if that thy valour stand on sympathy, <END>
there is my gage, aumerle, in gage to thine: <END>
by that fair sun which shows me where thou stand'st, <END>
i heard thee say, and vauntingly thou spakest it <END>
that thou wert cause of noble gloucester's death. <END>
if thou deny'st it twenty times, thou liest; <END>
and i will turn thy falsehood to thy heart, <END>
where it was forged, with my rapier's point. <END>
thou darest not, coward, live to see that day. <END>
now by my soul, i would it were this hour. <END>
fitzwater, thou art damn'd to hell for this. <END>
aumerle, thou liest; his honour is as true <END>
in this appeal as thou art all unjust; <END>
and that thou art so, there i throw my gage, <END>
to prove it on thee to the extremest point <END>
of mortal breathing: seize it, if thou darest. <END>
an if i do not, may my hands rot off <END>
and never brandish more revengeful steel <END>
over the glittering helmet of my foe! <END>
i task the earth to the like, forsworn aumerle; <END>
and spur thee on with full as many lies <END>
as may be holloa'd in thy treacherous ear <END>
from sun to sun: there is my honour's pawn; <END>
engage it to the trial, if thou darest. <END>
who sets me else? by heaven, i'll throw at all: <END>
i have a thousand spirits in one breast, <END>
to answer twenty thousand such as you. <END>
my lord fitzwater, i do remember well <END>
the very time aumerle and you did talk. <END>
'tis very true: you were in presence then; <END>
and you can witness with me this is true. <END>
as false, by heaven, as heaven itself is true. <END>
surrey, thou liest. <END>
dishonourable boy! <END>
that lie shall lie so heavy on my sword, <END>
that it shall render vengeance and revenge <END>
till thou the lie-giver and that lie do lie <END>
in earth as quiet as thy father's skull: <END>
in proof whereof, there is my honour's pawn; <END>
engage it to the trial, if thou darest. <END>
how fondly dost thou spur a forward horse! <END>
if i dare eat, or drink, or breathe, or live, <END>
i dare meet surrey in a wilderness, <END>
and spit upon him, whilst i say he lies, <END>
and lies, and lies: there is my bond of faith, <END>
to tie thee to my strong correction. <END>
as i intend to thrive in this new world, <END>
aumerle is guilty of my true appeal: <END>
besides, i heard the banish'd norfolk say <END>
that thou, aumerle, didst send two of thy men <END>
to execute the noble duke at calais. <END>
some honest christian trust me with a gage <END>
that norfolk lies: here do i throw down this, <END>
if he may be repeal'd, to try his honour. <END>
these differences shall all rest under gage <END>
till norfolk be repeal'd: repeal'd he shall be, <END>
and, though mine enemy, restored again <END>
to all his lands and signories: when he's return'd, <END>
against aumerle we will enforce his trial. <END>
that honourable day shall ne'er be seen. <END>
many a time hath banish'd norfolk fought <END>
for jesu christ in glorious christian field, <END>
streaming the ensign of the christian cross <END>
against black pagans, turks, and saracens: <END>
and toil'd with works of war, retired himself <END>
to italy; and there at venice gave <END>
his body to that pleasant country's earth, <END>
and his pure soul unto his captain christ, <END>
under whose colours he had fought so long. <END>
why, bishop, is norfolk dead? <END>
as surely as i live, my lord. <END>
sweet peace conduct his sweet soul to the bosom <END>
of good old abraham! lords appellants, <END>
your differences shall all rest under gage <END>
till we assign you to your days of trial. <END>
great duke of lancaster, i come to thee <END>
from plume-pluck'd richard; who with willing soul <END>
adopts thee heir, and his high sceptre yields <END>
to the possession of thy royal hand: <END>
ascend his throne, descending now from him; <END>
and long live henry, fourth of that name! <END>
in god's name, i'll ascend the regal throne. <END>
marry. god forbid! <END>
worst in this royal presence may i speak, <END>
yet best beseeming me to speak the truth. <END>
would god that any in this noble presence <END>
were enough noble to be upright judge <END>
of noble richard! then true noblesse would <END>
learn him forbearance from so foul a wrong. <END>
what subject can give sentence on his king? <END>
and who sits here that is not richard's subject? <END>
thieves are not judged but they are by to hear, <END>
although apparent guilt be seen in them; <END>
and shall the figure of god's majesty, <END>
his captain, steward, deputy-elect, <END>
anointed, crowned, planted many years, <END>
be judged by subject and inferior breath, <END>
and he himself not present? o, forfend it, god, <END>
that in a christian climate souls refined <END>
should show so heinous, black, obscene a deed! <END>
i speak to subjects, and a subject speaks, <END>
stirr'd up by god, thus boldly for his king: <END>
my lord of hereford here, whom you call king, <END>
is a foul traitor to proud hereford's king: <END>
and if you crown him, let me prophesy: <END>
the blood of english shall manure the ground, <END>
and future ages groan for this foul act; <END>
peace shall go sleep with turks and infidels, <END>
and in this seat of peace tumultuous wars <END>
shall kin with kin and kind with kind confound; <END>
disorder, horror, fear and mutiny <END>
shall here inhabit, and this land be call'd <END>
the field of golgotha and dead men's skulls. <END>
o, if you raise this house against this house, <END>
it will the woefullest division prove <END>
that ever fell upon this cursed earth. <END>
prevent it, resist it, let it not be so, <END>
lest child, child's children, cry against you woe! <END>
well have you argued, sir; and, for your pains, <END>
of capital treason we arrest you here. <END>
my lord of westminster, be it your charge <END>
to keep him safely till his day of trial. <END>
may it please you, lords, to grant the commons' suit. <END>
fetch hither richard, that in common view <END>
he may surrender; so we shall proceed <END>
without suspicion. <END>
i will be his conduct. <END>
lords, you that here are under our arrest, <END>
procure your sureties for your days of answer. <END>
little are we beholding to your love, <END>
and little look'd for at your helping hands. <END>
alack, why am i sent for to a king, <END>
before i have shook off the regal thoughts <END>
wherewith i reign'd? i hardly yet have learn'd <END>
to insinuate, flatter, bow, and bend my limbs: <END>
give sorrow leave awhile to tutor me <END>
to this submission. yet i well remember <END>
the favours of these men: were they not mine? <END>
did they not sometime cry, 'all hail!' to me? <END>
so judas did to christ: but he, in twelve, <END>
found truth in all but one: i, in twelve thousand, none. <END>
god save the king! will no man say amen? <END>
am i both priest and clerk? well then, amen. <END>
god save the king! although i be not he; <END>
and yet, amen, if heaven do think him me. <END>
to do what service am i sent for hither? <END>
to do that office of thine own good will <END>
which tired majesty did make thee offer, <END>
the resignation of thy state and crown <END>
to henry bolingbroke. <END>
give me the crown. here, cousin, seize the crown; <END>
here cousin: <END>
on this side my hand, and on that side yours. <END>
now is this golden crown like a deep well <END>
that owes two buckets, filling one another, <END>
the emptier ever dancing in the air, <END>
the other down, unseen and full of water: <END>
that bucket down and full of tears am i, <END>
drinking my griefs, whilst you mount up on high. <END>
i thought you had been willing to resign. <END>
my crown i am; but still my griefs are mine: <END>
you may my glories and my state depose, <END>
but not my griefs; still am i king of those. <END>
part of your cares you give me with your crown. <END>
your cares set up do not pluck my cares down. <END>
my care is loss of care, by old care done; <END>
your care is gain of care, by new care won: <END>
the cares i give i have, though given away; <END>
they tend the crown, yet still with me they stay. <END>
are you contented to resign the crown? <END>
ay, no; no, ay; for i must nothing be; <END>
therefore no no, for i resign to thee. <END>
now mark me, how i will undo myself; <END>
i give this heavy weight from off my head <END>
and this unwieldy sceptre from my hand, <END>
the pride of kingly sway from out my heart; <END>
with mine own tears i wash away my balm, <END>
with mine own hands i give away my crown, <END>
with mine own tongue deny my sacred state, <END>
with mine own breath release all duty's rites: <END>
all pomp and majesty i do forswear; <END>
my manors, rents, revenues i forego; <END>
my acts, decrees, and statutes i deny: <END>
god pardon all oaths that are broke to me! <END>
god keep all vows unbroke that swear to thee! <END>
make me, that nothing have, with nothing grieved, <END>
and thou with all pleased, that hast all achieved! <END>
long mayst thou live in richard's seat to sit, <END>
and soon lie richard in an earthly pit! <END>
god save king harry, unking'd richard says, <END>
and send him many years of sunshine days! <END>
what more remains? <END>
no more, but that you read <END>
these accusations and these grievous crimes <END>
committed by your person and your followers <END>
against the state and profit of this land; <END>
that, by confessing them, the souls of men <END>
may deem that you are worthily deposed. <END>
must i do so? and must i ravel out <END>
my weaved-up folly? gentle northumberland, <END>
if thy offences were upon record, <END>
would it not shame thee in so fair a troop <END>
to read a lecture of them? if thou wouldst, <END>
there shouldst thou find one heinous article, <END>
containing the deposing of a king <END>
and cracking the strong warrant of an oath, <END>
mark'd with a blot, damn'd in the book of heaven: <END>
nay, all of you that stand and look upon, <END>
whilst that my wretchedness doth bait myself, <END>
though some of you with pilate wash your hands <END>
showing an outward pity; yet you pilates <END>
have here deliver'd me to my sour cross, <END>
and water cannot wash away your sin. <END>
my lord, dispatch; read o'er these articles. <END>
mine eyes are full of tears, i cannot see: <END>
and yet salt water blinds them not so much <END>
but they can see a sort of traitors here. <END>
nay, if i turn mine eyes upon myself, <END>
i find myself a traitor with the rest; <END>
for i have given here my soul's consent <END>
to undeck the pompous body of a king; <END>
made glory base and sovereignty a slave, <END>
proud majesty a subject, state a peasant. <END>
my lord,-- <END>
no lord of thine, thou haught insulting man, <END>
nor no man's lord; i have no name, no title, <END>
no, not that name was given me at the font, <END>
but 'tis usurp'd: alack the heavy day, <END>
that i have worn so many winters out, <END>
and know not now what name to call myself! <END>
o that i were a mockery king of snow, <END>
standing before the sun of bolingbroke, <END>
to melt myself away in water-drops! <END>
good king, great king, and yet not greatly good, <END>
an if my word be sterling yet in england, <END>
let it command a mirror hither straight, <END>
that it may show me what a face i have, <END>
since it is bankrupt of his majesty. <END>
go some of you and fetch a looking-glass. <END>
read o'er this paper while the glass doth come. <END>
fiend, thou torment'st me ere i come to hell! <END>
urge it no more, my lord northumberland. <END>
the commons will not then be satisfied. <END>
they shall be satisfied: i'll read enough, <END>
when i do see the very book indeed <END>
where all my sins are writ, and that's myself. <END>
give me the glass, and therein will i read. <END>
no deeper wrinkles yet? hath sorrow struck <END>
so many blows upon this face of mine, <END>
and made no deeper wounds? o flattering glass, <END>
like to my followers in prosperity, <END>
thou dost beguile me! was this face the face <END>
that every day under his household roof <END>
did keep ten thousand men? was this the face <END>
that, like the sun, did make beholders wink? <END>
was this the face that faced so many follies, <END>
and was at last out-faced by bolingbroke? <END>
a brittle glory shineth in this face: <END>
as brittle as the glory is the face; <END>
for there it is, crack'd in a hundred shivers. <END>
mark, silent king, the moral of this sport, <END>
how soon my sorrow hath destroy'd my face. <END>
the shadow of your sorrow hath destroy'd <END>
the shadow or your face. <END>
say that again. <END>
the shadow of my sorrow! ha! let's see: <END>
'tis very true, my grief lies all within; <END>
and these external manners of laments <END>
are merely shadows to the unseen grief <END>
that swells with silence in the tortured soul; <END>
there lies the substance: and i thank thee, king, <END>
for thy great bounty, that not only givest <END>
me cause to wail but teachest me the way <END>
how to lament the cause. i'll beg one boon, <END>
and then be gone and trouble you no more. <END>
shall i obtain it? <END>
name it, fair cousin. <END>
'fair cousin'? i am greater than a king: <END>
for when i was a king, my flatterers <END>
were then but subjects; being now a subject, <END>
i have a king here to my flatterer. <END>
being so great, i have no need to beg. <END>
yet ask. <END>
and shall i have? <END>
you shall. <END>
then give me leave to go. <END>
whither? <END>
whither you will, so i were from your sights. <END>
go, some of you convey him to the tower. <END>
o, good! convey? conveyers are you all, <END>
that rise thus nimbly by a true king's fall. <END>
on wednesday next we solemnly set down <END>
our coronation: lords, prepare yourselves. <END>
a woeful pageant have we here beheld. <END>
the woe's to come; the children yet unborn. <END>
shall feel this day as sharp to them as thorn. <END>
you holy clergymen, is there no plot <END>
to rid the realm of this pernicious blot? <END>
my lord, <END>
before i freely speak my mind herein, <END>
you shall not only take the sacrament <END>
to bury mine intents, but also to effect <END>
whatever i shall happen to devise. <END>
i see your brows are full of discontent, <END>
your hearts of sorrow and your eyes of tears: <END>
come home with me to supper; and i'll lay <END>
a plot shall show us all a merry day. <END>
this way the king will come; this is the way <END>
to julius caesar's ill-erected tower, <END>
to whose flint bosom my condemned lord <END>
is doom'd a prisoner by proud bolingbroke: <END>
here let us rest, if this rebellious earth <END>
have any resting for her true king's queen. <END>
but soft, but see, or rather do not see, <END>
my fair rose wither: yet look up, behold, <END>
that you in pity may dissolve to dew, <END>
and wash him fresh again with true-love tears. <END>
ah, thou, the model where old troy did stand, <END>
thou map of honour, thou king richard's tomb, <END>
and not king richard; thou most beauteous inn, <END>
why should hard-favour'd grief be lodged in thee, <END>
when triumph is become an alehouse guest? <END>
join not with grief, fair woman, do not so, <END>
to make my end too sudden: learn, good soul, <END>
to think our former state a happy dream; <END>
from which awaked, the truth of what we are <END>
shows us but this: i am sworn brother, sweet, <END>
to grim necessity, and he and i <END>
will keep a league till death. hie thee to france <END>
and cloister thee in some religious house: <END>
our holy lives must win a new world's crown, <END>
which our profane hours here have stricken down. <END>
what, is my richard both in shape and mind <END>
transform'd and weaken'd? hath bolingbroke deposed <END>
thine intellect? hath he been in thy heart? <END>
the lion dying thrusteth forth his paw, <END>
and wounds the earth, if nothing else, with rage <END>
to be o'erpower'd; and wilt thou, pupil-like, <END>
take thy correction mildly, kiss the rod, <END>
and fawn on rage with base humility, <END>
which art a lion and a king of beasts? <END>
a king of beasts, indeed; if aught but beasts, <END>
i had been still a happy king of men. <END>
good sometime queen, prepare thee hence for france: <END>
think i am dead and that even here thou takest, <END>
as from my death-bed, thy last living leave. <END>
in winter's tedious nights sit by the fire <END>
with good old folks and let them tell thee tales <END>
of woeful ages long ago betid; <END>
and ere thou bid good night, to quit their griefs, <END>
tell thou the lamentable tale of me <END>
and send the hearers weeping to their beds: <END>
for why, the senseless brands will sympathize <END>
the heavy accent of thy moving tongue <END>
and in compassion weep the fire out; <END>
and some will mourn in ashes, some coal-black, <END>
for the deposing of a rightful king. <END>
my lord, the mind of bolingbroke is changed: <END>
you must to pomfret, not unto the tower. <END>
and, madam, there is order ta'en for you; <END>
with all swift speed you must away to france. <END>
northumberland, thou ladder wherewithal <END>
the mounting bolingbroke ascends my throne, <END>
the time shall not be many hours of age <END>
more than it is ere foul sin gathering head <END>
shalt break into corruption: thou shalt think, <END>
though he divide the realm and give thee half, <END>
it is too little, helping him to all; <END>
and he shall think that thou, which know'st the way <END>
to plant unrightful kings, wilt know again, <END>
being ne'er so little urged, another way <END>
to pluck him headlong from the usurped throne. <END>
the love of wicked men converts to fear; <END>
that fear to hate, and hate turns one or both <END>
to worthy danger and deserved death. <END>
my guilt be on my head, and there an end. <END>
take leave and part; for you must part forthwith. <END>
doubly divorced! bad men, you violate <END>
a twofold marriage, 'twixt my crown and me, <END>
and then betwixt me and my married wife. <END>
let me unkiss the oath 'twixt thee and me; <END>
and yet not so, for with a kiss 'twas made. <END>
part us, northumberland; i toward the north, <END>
where shivering cold and sickness pines the clime; <END>
my wife to france: from whence, set forth in pomp, <END>
she came adorned hither like sweet may, <END>
sent back like hallowmas or short'st of day. <END>
and must we be divided? must we part? <END>
ay, hand from hand, my love, and heart from heart. <END>
banish us both and send the king with me. <END>
that were some love but little policy. <END>
then whither he goes, thither let me go. <END>
so two, together weeping, make one woe. <END>
weep thou for me in france, i for thee here; <END>
better far off than near, be ne'er the near. <END>
go, count thy way with sighs; i mine with groans. <END>
so longest way shall have the longest moans. <END>
twice for one step i'll groan, the way being short, <END>
and piece the way out with a heavy heart. <END>
come, come, in wooing sorrow let's be brief, <END>
since, wedding it, there is such length in grief; <END>
one kiss shall stop our mouths, and dumbly part; <END>
thus give i mine, and thus take i thy heart. <END>
give me mine own again; 'twere no good part <END>
to take on me to keep and kill thy heart. <END>
so, now i have mine own again, be gone, <END>
that i might strive to kill it with a groan. <END>
we make woe wanton with this fond delay: <END>
once more, adieu; the rest let sorrow say. <END>
my lord, you told me you would tell the rest, <END>
when weeping made you break the story off, <END>
of our two cousins coming into london. <END>
where did i leave? <END>
at that sad stop, my lord, <END>
where rude misgovern'd hands from windows' tops <END>
threw dust and rubbish on king richard's head. <END>
then, as i said, the duke, great bolingbroke, <END>
mounted upon a hot and fiery steed <END>
which his aspiring rider seem'd to know, <END>
with slow but stately pace kept on his course, <END>
whilst all tongues cried 'god save thee, <END>
bolingbroke!' <END>
you would have thought the very windows spake, <END>
so many greedy looks of young and old <END>
through casements darted their desiring eyes <END>
upon his visage, and that all the walls <END>
with painted imagery had said at once <END>
'jesu preserve thee! welcome, bolingbroke!' <END>
whilst he, from the one side to the other turning, <END>
bareheaded, lower than his proud steed's neck, <END>
bespake them thus: 'i thank you, countrymen:' <END>
and thus still doing, thus he pass'd along. <END>
alack, poor richard! where rode he the whilst? <END>
as in a theatre, the eyes of men, <END>
after a well-graced actor leaves the stage, <END>
are idly bent on him that enters next, <END>
thinking his prattle to be tedious; <END>
even so, or with much more contempt, men's eyes <END>
did scowl on gentle richard; no man cried 'god save him!' <END>
no joyful tongue gave him his welcome home: <END>
but dust was thrown upon his sacred head: <END>
which with such gentle sorrow he shook off, <END>
his face still combating with tears and smiles, <END>
the badges of his grief and patience, <END>
that had not god, for some strong purpose, steel'd <END>
the hearts of men, they must perforce have melted <END>
and barbarism itself have pitied him. <END>
but heaven hath a hand in these events, <END>
to whose high will we bound our calm contents. <END>
to bolingbroke are we sworn subjects now, <END>
whose state and honour i for aye allow. <END>
here comes my son aumerle. <END>
aumerle that was; <END>
but that is lost for being richard's friend, <END>
and, madam, you must call him rutland now: <END>
i am in parliament pledge for his truth <END>
and lasting fealty to the new-made king. <END>
welcome, my son: who are the violets now <END>
that strew the green lap of the new come spring? <END>
madam, i know not, nor i greatly care not: <END>
god knows i had as lief be none as one. <END>
well, bear you well in this new spring of time, <END>
lest you be cropp'd before you come to prime. <END>
what news from oxford? hold those justs and triumphs? <END>
for aught i know, my lord, they do. <END>
you will be there, i know. <END>
if god prevent not, i purpose so. <END>
what seal is that, that hangs without thy bosom? <END>
yea, look'st thou pale? let me see the writing. <END>
my lord, 'tis nothing. <END>
no matter, then, who see it; <END>
i will be satisfied; let me see the writing. <END>
i do beseech your grace to pardon me: <END>
it is a matter of small consequence, <END>
which for some reasons i would not have seen. <END>
which for some reasons, sir, i mean to see. <END>
i fear, i fear,-- <END>
what should you fear? <END>
'tis nothing but some bond, that he is enter'd into <END>
for gay apparel 'gainst the triumph day. <END>
bound to himself! what doth he with a bond <END>
that he is bound to? wife, thou art a fool. <END>
boy, let me see the writing. <END>
i do beseech you, pardon me; i may not show it. <END>
i will be satisfied; let me see it, i say. <END>
treason! foul treason! villain! traitor! slave! <END>
what is the matter, my lord? <END>
ho! who is within there? <END>
saddle my horse. <END>
god for his mercy, what treachery is here! <END>
why, what is it, my lord? <END>
give me my boots, i say; saddle my horse. <END>
now, by mine honour, by my life, by my troth, <END>
i will appeach the villain. <END>
what is the matter? <END>
peace, foolish woman. <END>
i will not peace. what is the matter, aumerle. <END>
good mother, be content; it is no more <END>
than my poor life must answer. <END>
thy life answer! <END>
bring me my boots: i will unto the king. <END>
strike him, aumerle. poor boy, thou art amazed. <END>
hence, villain! never more come in my sight. <END>
give me my boots, i say. <END>
why, york, what wilt thou do? <END>
wilt thou not hide the trespass of thine own? <END>
have we more sons? or are we like to have? <END>
is not my teeming date drunk up with time? <END>
and wilt thou pluck my fair son from mine age, <END>
and rob me of a happy mother's name? <END>
is he not like thee? is he not thine own? <END>
thou fond mad woman, <END>
wilt thou conceal this dark conspiracy? <END>
a dozen of them here have ta'en the sacrament, <END>
and interchangeably set down their hands, <END>
to kill the king at oxford. <END>
he shall be none; <END>
we'll keep him here: then what is that to him? <END>
away, fond woman! were he twenty times my son, <END>
i would appeach him. <END>
hadst thou groan'd for him <END>
as i have done, thou wouldst be more pitiful. <END>
but now i know thy mind; thou dost suspect <END>
that i have been disloyal to thy bed, <END>
and that he is a bastard, not thy son: <END>
sweet york, sweet husband, be not of that mind: <END>
he is as like thee as a man may be, <END>
not like to me, or any of my kin, <END>
and yet i love him. <END>
make way, unruly woman! <END>
after, aumerle! mount thee upon his horse; <END>
spur post, and get before him to the king, <END>
and beg thy pardon ere he do accuse thee. <END>
i'll not be long behind; though i be old, <END>
i doubt not but to ride as fast as york: <END>
and never will i rise up from the ground <END>
till bolingbroke have pardon'd thee. away, be gone! <END>
can no man tell me of my unthrifty son? <END>
'tis full three months since i did see him last; <END>
if any plague hang over us, 'tis he. <END>
i would to god, my lords, he might be found: <END>
inquire at london, 'mongst the taverns there, <END>
for there, they say, he daily doth frequent, <END>
with unrestrained loose companions, <END>
even such, they say, as stand in narrow lanes, <END>
and beat our watch, and rob our passengers; <END>
which he, young wanton and effeminate boy, <END>
takes on the point of honour to support <END>
so dissolute a crew. <END>
my lord, some two days since i saw the prince, <END>
and told him of those triumphs held at oxford. <END>
and what said the gallant? <END>
his answer was, he would unto the stews, <END>
and from the common'st creature pluck a glove, <END>
and wear it as a favour; and with that <END>
he would unhorse the lustiest challenger. <END>
as dissolute as desperate; yet through both <END>
i see some sparks of better hope, which elder years <END>
may happily bring forth. but who comes here? <END>
where is the king? <END>
what means our cousin, that he stares and looks <END>
so wildly? <END>
god save your grace! i do beseech your majesty, <END>
to have some conference with your grace alone. <END>
withdraw yourselves, and leave us here alone. <END>
what is the matter with our cousin now? <END>
for ever may my knees grow to the earth, <END>
my tongue cleave to my roof within my mouth <END>
unless a pardon ere i rise or speak. <END>
intended or committed was this fault? <END>
if on the first, how heinous e'er it be, <END>
to win thy after-love i pardon thee. <END>
then give me leave that i may turn the key, <END>
that no man enter till my tale be done. <END>
have thy desire. <END>
villain, i'll make thee safe. <END>
stay thy revengeful hand; thou hast no cause to fear. <END>
what is the matter, uncle? speak; <END>
recover breath; tell us how near is danger, <END>
that we may arm us to encounter it. <END>
peruse this writing here, and thou shalt know <END>
the treason that my haste forbids me show. <END>
remember, as thou read'st, thy promise pass'd: <END>
i do repent me; read not my name there <END>
my heart is not confederate with my hand. <END>
it was, villain, ere thy hand did set it down. <END>
i tore it from the traitor's bosom, king; <END>
fear, and not love, begets his penitence: <END>
forget to pity him, lest thy pity prove <END>
a serpent that will sting thee to the heart. <END>
o heinous, strong and bold conspiracy! <END>
o loyal father of a treacherous son! <END>
thou sheer, immaculate and silver fountain, <END>
from when this stream through muddy passages <END>
hath held his current and defiled himself! <END>
thy overflow of good converts to bad, <END>
and thy abundant goodness shall excuse <END>
this deadly blot in thy digressing son. <END>
so shall my virtue be his vice's bawd; <END>
and he shall spend mine honour with his shame, <END>
as thriftless sons their scraping fathers' gold. <END>
mine honour lives when his dishonour dies, <END>
or my shamed life in his dishonour lies: <END>
thou kill'st me in his life; giving him breath, <END>
the traitor lives, the true man's put to death. <END>
what shrill-voiced suppliant makes this eager cry? <END>
a woman, and thy aunt, great king; 'tis i. <END>
speak with me, pity me, open the door. <END>
a beggar begs that never begg'd before. <END>
our scene is alter'd from a serious thing, <END>
and now changed to 'the beggar and the king.' <END>
my dangerous cousin, let your mother in: <END>
i know she is come to pray for your foul sin. <END>
if thou do pardon, whosoever pray, <END>
more sins for this forgiveness prosper may. <END>
this fester'd joint cut off, the rest rest sound; <END>
this let alone will all the rest confound. <END>
o king, believe not this hard-hearted man! <END>
love loving not itself none other can. <END>
thou frantic woman, what dost thou make here? <END>
shall thy old dugs once more a traitor rear? <END>
sweet york, be patient. hear me, gentle liege. <END>
rise up, good aunt. <END>
not yet, i thee beseech: <END>
for ever will i walk upon my knees, <END>
and never see day that the happy sees, <END>
till thou give joy; until thou bid me joy, <END>
by pardoning rutland, my transgressing boy. <END>
unto my mother's prayers i bend my knee. <END>
against them both my true joints bended be. <END>
ill mayst thou thrive, if thou grant any grace! <END>
pleads he in earnest? look upon his face; <END>
his eyes do drop no tears, his prayers are in jest; <END>
his words come from his mouth, ours from our breast: <END>
he prays but faintly and would be denied; <END>
we pray with heart and soul and all beside: <END>
his weary joints would gladly rise, i know; <END>
our knees shall kneel till to the ground they grow: <END>
his prayers are full of false hypocrisy; <END>
ours of true zeal and deep integrity. <END>
our prayers do out-pray his; then let them have <END>
that mercy which true prayer ought to have. <END>
good aunt, stand up. <END>
nay, do not say, 'stand up;' <END>
say, 'pardon' first, and afterwards 'stand up.' <END>
and if i were thy nurse, thy tongue to teach, <END>
'pardon' should be the first word of thy speech. <END>
i never long'd to hear a word till now; <END>
say 'pardon,' king; let pity teach thee how: <END>
the word is short, but not so short as sweet; <END>
no word like 'pardon' for kings' mouths so meet. <END>
speak it in french, king; say, 'pardonne moi.' <END>
dost thou teach pardon pardon to destroy? <END>
ah, my sour husband, my hard-hearted lord, <END>
that set'st the word itself against the word! <END>
speak 'pardon' as 'tis current in our land; <END>
the chopping french we do not understand. <END>
thine eye begins to speak; set thy tongue there; <END>
or in thy piteous heart plant thou thine ear; <END>
that hearing how our plaints and prayers do pierce, <END>
pity may move thee 'pardon' to rehearse. <END>
good aunt, stand up. <END>
i do not sue to stand; <END>
pardon is all the suit i have in hand. <END>
i pardon him, as god shall pardon me. <END>
o happy vantage of a kneeling knee! <END>
yet am i sick for fear: speak it again; <END>
twice saying 'pardon' doth not pardon twain, <END>
but makes one pardon strong. <END>
with all my heart <END>
i pardon him. <END>
a god on earth thou art. <END>
but for our trusty brother-in-law and the abbot, <END>
with all the rest of that consorted crew, <END>
destruction straight shall dog them at the heels. <END>
good uncle, help to order several powers <END>
to oxford, or where'er these traitors are: <END>
they shall not live within this world, i swear, <END>
but i will have them, if i once know where. <END>
uncle, farewell: and, cousin too, adieu: <END>
your mother well hath pray'd, and prove you true. <END>
come, my old son: i pray god make thee new. <END>
didst thou not mark the king, what words he spake, <END>
'have i no friend will rid me of this living fear?' <END>
was it not so? <END>
these were his very words. <END>
'have i no friend?' quoth he: he spake it twice, <END>
and urged it twice together, did he not? <END>
he did. <END>
and speaking it, he wistly look'd on me, <END>
and who should say, 'i would thou wert the man' <END>
that would divorce this terror from my heart;' <END>
meaning the king at pomfret. come, let's go: <END>
i am the king's friend, and will rid his foe. <END>
i have been studying how i may compare <END>
this prison where i live unto the world: <END>
and for because the world is populous <END>
and here is not a creature but myself, <END>
i cannot do it; yet i'll hammer it out. <END>
my brain i'll prove the female to my soul, <END>
my soul the father; and these two beget <END>
a generation of still-breeding thoughts, <END>
and these same thoughts people this little world, <END>
in humours like the people of this world, <END>
for no thought is contented. the better sort, <END>
as thoughts of things divine, are intermix'd <END>
with scruples and do set the word itself <END>
against the word: <END>
as thus, 'come, little ones,' and then again, <END>
'it is as hard to come as for a camel <END>
to thread the postern of a small needle's eye.' <END>
thoughts tending to ambition, they do plot <END>
unlikely wonders; how these vain weak nails <END>
may tear a passage through the flinty ribs <END>
of this hard world, my ragged prison walls, <END>
and, for they cannot, die in their own pride. <END>
thoughts tending to content flatter themselves <END>
that they are not the first of fortune's slaves, <END>
nor shall not be the last; like silly beggars <END>
who sitting in the stocks refuge their shame, <END>
that many have and others must sit there; <END>
and in this thought they find a kind of ease, <END>
bearing their own misfortunes on the back <END>
of such as have before endured the like. <END>
thus play i in one person many people, <END>
and none contented: sometimes am i king; <END>
then treasons make me wish myself a beggar, <END>
and so i am: then crushing penury <END>
persuades me i was better when a king; <END>
then am i king'd again: and by and by <END>
think that i am unking'd by bolingbroke, <END>
and straight am nothing: but whate'er i be, <END>
nor i nor any man that but man is <END>
with nothing shall be pleased, till he be eased <END>
with being nothing. music do i hear? <END>
ha, ha! keep time: how sour sweet music is, <END>
when time is broke and no proportion kept! <END>
so is it in the music of men's lives. <END>
and here have i the daintiness of ear <END>
to cheque time broke in a disorder'd string; <END>
but for the concord of my state and time <END>
had not an ear to hear my true time broke. <END>
i wasted time, and now doth time waste me; <END>
for now hath time made me his numbering clock: <END>
my thoughts are minutes; and with sighs they jar <END>
their watches on unto mine eyes, the outward watch, <END>
whereto my finger, like a dial's point, <END>
is pointing still, in cleansing them from tears. <END>
now sir, the sound that tells what hour it is <END>
are clamorous groans, which strike upon my heart, <END>
which is the bell: so sighs and tears and groans <END>
show minutes, times, and hours: but my time <END>
runs posting on in bolingbroke's proud joy, <END>
while i stand fooling here, his jack o' the clock. <END>
this music mads me; let it sound no more; <END>
for though it have holp madmen to their wits, <END>
in me it seems it will make wise men mad. <END>
yet blessing on his heart that gives it me! <END>
for 'tis a sign of love; and love to richard <END>
is a strange brooch in this all-hating world. <END>
hail, royal prince! <END>
thanks, noble peer; <END>
the cheapest of us is ten groats too dear. <END>
what art thou? and how comest thou hither, <END>
where no man never comes but that sad dog <END>
that brings me food to make misfortune live? <END>
i was a poor groom of thy stable, king, <END>
when thou wert king; who, travelling towards york, <END>
with much ado at length have gotten leave <END>
to look upon my sometimes royal master's face. <END>
o, how it yearn'd my heart when i beheld <END>
in london streets, that coronation-day, <END>
when bolingbroke rode on roan barbary, <END>
that horse that thou so often hast bestrid, <END>
that horse that i so carefully have dress'd! <END>
rode he on barbary? tell me, gentle friend, <END>
how went he under him? <END>
so proudly as if he disdain'd the ground. <END>
so proud that bolingbroke was on his back! <END>
that jade hath eat bread from my royal hand; <END>
this hand hath made him proud with clapping him. <END>
would he not stumble? would he not fall down, <END>
since pride must have a fall, and break the neck <END>
of that proud man that did usurp his back? <END>
forgiveness, horse! why do i rail on thee, <END>
since thou, created to be awed by man, <END>
wast born to bear? i was not made a horse; <END>
and yet i bear a burthen like an ass, <END>
spurr'd, gall'd and tired by jouncing bolingbroke. <END>
fellow, give place; here is no longer stay. <END>
if thou love me, 'tis time thou wert away. <END>
what my tongue dares not, that my heart shall say. <END>
my lord, will't please you to fall to? <END>
taste of it first, as thou art wont to do. <END>
my lord, i dare not: sir pierce of exton, who <END>
lately came from the king, commands the contrary. <END>
the devil take henry of lancaster and thee! <END>
patience is stale, and i am weary of it. <END>
help, help, help! <END>
how now! what means death in this rude assault? <END>
villain, thy own hand yields thy death's instrument. <END>
go thou, and fill another room in hell. <END>
that hand shall burn in never-quenching fire <END>
that staggers thus my person. exton, thy fierce hand <END>
hath with the king's blood stain'd the king's own land. <END>
mount, mount, my soul! thy seat is up on high; <END>
whilst my gross flesh sinks downward, here to die. <END>
as full of valour as of royal blood: <END>
both have i spill'd; o would the deed were good! <END>
for now the devil, that told me i did well, <END>
says that this deed is chronicled in hell. <END>
this dead king to the living king i'll bear <END>
take hence the rest, and give them burial here. <END>
kind uncle york, the latest news we hear <END>
is that the rebels have consumed with fire <END>
our town of cicester in gloucestershire; <END>
but whether they be ta'en or slain we hear not. <END>
welcome, my lord what is the news? <END>
first, to thy sacred state wish i all happiness. <END>
the next news is, i have to london sent <END>
the heads of oxford, salisbury, blunt, and kent: <END>
the manner of their taking may appear <END>
at large discoursed in this paper here. <END>
we thank thee, gentle percy, for thy pains; <END>
and to thy worth will add right worthy gains. <END>
my lord, i have from oxford sent to london <END>
the heads of brocas and sir bennet seely, <END>
two of the dangerous consorted traitors <END>
that sought at oxford thy dire overthrow. <END>
thy pains, fitzwater, shall not be forgot; <END>
right noble is thy merit, well i wot. <END>
the grand conspirator, abbot of westminster, <END>
with clog of conscience and sour melancholy <END>
hath yielded up his body to the grave; <END>
but here is carlisle living, to abide <END>
thy kingly doom and sentence of his pride. <END>
carlisle, this is your doom: <END>
choose out some secret place, some reverend room, <END>
more than thou hast, and with it joy thy life; <END>
so as thou livest in peace, die free from strife: <END>
for though mine enemy thou hast ever been, <END>
high sparks of honour in thee have i seen. <END>
great king, within this coffin i present <END>
thy buried fear: herein all breathless lies <END>
the mightiest of thy greatest enemies, <END>
richard of bordeaux, by me hither brought. <END>
exton, i thank thee not; for thou hast wrought <END>
a deed of slander with thy fatal hand <END>
upon my head and all this famous land. <END>
from your own mouth, my lord, did i this deed. <END>
they love not poison that do poison need, <END>
nor do i thee: though i did wish him dead, <END>
i hate the murderer, love him murdered. <END>
the guilt of conscience take thou for thy labour, <END>
but neither my good word nor princely favour: <END>
with cain go wander through shades of night, <END>
and never show thy head by day nor light. <END>
lords, i protest, my soul is full of woe, <END>
that blood should sprinkle me to make me grow: <END>
come, mourn with me for that i do lament, <END>
and put on sullen black incontinent: <END>
i'll make a voyage to the holy land, <END>
to wash this blood off from my guilty hand: <END>
march sadly after; grace my mournings here; <END>
in weeping after this untimely bier. <END>
gregory, o' my word, we'll not carry coals. <END>
no, for then we should be colliers. <END>
i mean, an we be in choler, we'll draw. <END>
ay, while you live, draw your neck out o' the collar. <END>
i strike quickly, being moved. <END>
but thou art not quickly moved to strike. <END>
a dog of the house of montague moves me. <END>
to move is to stir; and to be valiant is to stand: <END>
therefore, if thou art moved, thou runn'st away. <END>
a dog of that house shall move me to stand: i will <END>
take the wall of any man or maid of montague's. <END>
that shows thee a weak slave; for the weakest goes <END>
to the wall. <END>
true; and therefore women, being the weaker vessels, <END>
are ever thrust to the wall: therefore i will push <END>
montague's men from the wall, and thrust his maids <END>
to the wall. <END>
the quarrel is between our masters and us their men. <END>
'tis all one, i will show myself a tyrant: when i <END>
have fought with the men, i will be cruel with the <END>
maids, and cut off their heads. <END>
the heads of the maids? <END>
ay, the heads of the maids, or their maidenheads; <END>
take it in what sense thou wilt. <END>
they must take it in sense that feel it. <END>
me they shall feel while i am able to stand: and <END>
'tis known i am a pretty piece of flesh. <END>
'tis well thou art not fish; if thou hadst, thou <END>
hadst been poor john. draw thy tool! here comes <END>
two of the house of the montagues. <END>
my naked weapon is out: quarrel, i will back thee. <END>
how! turn thy back and run? <END>
fear me not. <END>
no, marry; i fear thee! <END>
let us take the law of our sides; let them begin. <END>
i will frown as i pass by, and let them take it as <END>
they list. <END>
nay, as they dare. i will bite my thumb at them; <END>
which is a disgrace to them, if they bear it. <END>
do you bite your thumb at us, sir? <END>
i do bite my thumb, sir. <END>
do you bite your thumb at us, sir? <END>
no. <END>
no, sir, i do not bite my thumb at you, sir, but i <END>
bite my thumb, sir. <END>
do you quarrel, sir? <END>
quarrel sir! no, sir. <END>
if you do, sir, i am for you: i serve as good a man as you. <END>
no better. <END>
well, sir. <END>
say 'better:' here comes one of my master's kinsmen. <END>
yes, better, sir. <END>
you lie. <END>
draw, if you be men. gregory, remember thy swashing blow. <END>
part, fools! <END>
put up your swords; you know not what you do. <END>
what, art thou drawn among these heartless hinds? <END>
turn thee, benvolio, look upon thy death. <END>
i do but keep the peace: put up thy sword, <END>
or manage it to part these men with me. <END>
what, drawn, and talk of peace! i hate the word, <END>
as i hate hell, all montagues, and thee: <END>
have at thee, coward! <END>
clubs, bills, and partisans! strike! beat them down! <END>
down with the capulets! down with the montagues! <END>
what noise is this? give me my long sword, ho! <END>
a crutch, a crutch! why call you for a sword? <END>
my sword, i say! old montague is come, <END>
and flourishes his blade in spite of me. <END>
thou villain capulet,--hold me not, let me go. <END>
thou shalt not stir a foot to seek a foe. <END>
rebellious subjects, enemies to peace, <END>
profaners of this neighbour-stained steel,-- <END>
will they not hear? what, ho! you men, you beasts, <END>
that quench the fire of your pernicious rage <END>
with purple fountains issuing from your veins, <END>
on pain of torture, from those bloody hands <END>
throw your mistemper'd weapons to the ground, <END>
and hear the sentence of your moved prince. <END>
three civil brawls, bred of an airy word, <END>
by thee, old capulet, and montague, <END>
have thrice disturb'd the quiet of our streets, <END>
and made verona's ancient citizens <END>
cast by their grave beseeming ornaments, <END>
to wield old partisans, in hands as old, <END>
canker'd with peace, to part your canker'd hate: <END>
if ever you disturb our streets again, <END>
your lives shall pay the forfeit of the peace. <END>
for this time, all the rest depart away: <END>
you capulet; shall go along with me: <END>
and, montague, come you this afternoon, <END>
to know our further pleasure in this case, <END>
to old free-town, our common judgment-place. <END>
once more, on pain of death, all men depart. <END>
who set this ancient quarrel new abroach? <END>
speak, nephew, were you by when it began? <END>
here were the servants of your adversary, <END>
and yours, close fighting ere i did approach: <END>
i drew to part them: in the instant came <END>
the fiery tybalt, with his sword prepared, <END>
which, as he breathed defiance to my ears, <END>
he swung about his head and cut the winds, <END>
who nothing hurt withal hiss'd him in scorn: <END>
while we were interchanging thrusts and blows, <END>
came more and more and fought on part and part, <END>
till the prince came, who parted either part. <END>
o, where is romeo? saw you him to-day? <END>
right glad i am he was not at this fray. <END>
madam, an hour before the worshipp'd sun <END>
peer'd forth the golden window of the east, <END>
a troubled mind drave me to walk abroad; <END>
where, underneath the grove of sycamore <END>
that westward rooteth from the city's side, <END>
so early walking did i see your son: <END>
towards him i made, but he was ware of me <END>
and stole into the covert of the wood: <END>
i, measuring his affections by my own, <END>
that most are busied when they're most alone, <END>
pursued my humour not pursuing his, <END>
and gladly shunn'd who gladly fled from me. <END>
many a morning hath he there been seen, <END>
with tears augmenting the fresh morning dew. <END>
adding to clouds more clouds with his deep sighs; <END>
but all so soon as the all-cheering sun <END>
should in the furthest east begin to draw <END>
the shady curtains from aurora's bed, <END>
away from the light steals home my heavy son, <END>
and private in his chamber pens himself, <END>
shuts up his windows, locks far daylight out <END>
and makes himself an artificial night: <END>
black and portentous must this humour prove, <END>
unless good counsel may the cause remove. <END>
my noble uncle, do you know the cause? <END>
i neither know it nor can learn of him. <END>
have you importuned him by any means? <END>
both by myself and many other friends: <END>
but he, his own affections' counsellor, <END>
is to himself--i will not say how true-- <END>
but to himself so secret and so close, <END>
so far from sounding and discovery, <END>
as is the bud bit with an envious worm, <END>
ere he can spread his sweet leaves to the air, <END>
or dedicate his beauty to the sun. <END>
could we but learn from whence his sorrows grow. <END>
we would as willingly give cure as know. <END>
see, where he comes: so please you, step aside; <END>
i'll know his grievance, or be much denied. <END>
i would thou wert so happy by thy stay, <END>
to hear true shrift. come, madam, let's away. <END>
good-morrow, cousin. <END>
is the day so young? <END>
but new struck nine. <END>
ay me! sad hours seem long. <END>
was that my father that went hence so fast? <END>
it was. what sadness lengthens romeo's hours? <END>
not having that, which, having, makes them short. <END>
in love? <END>
out-- <END>
of love? <END>
out of her favour, where i am in love. <END>
alas, that love, so gentle in his view, <END>
should be so tyrannous and rough in proof! <END>
alas, that love, whose view is muffled still, <END>
should, without eyes, see pathways to his will! <END>
where shall we dine? o me! what fray was here? <END>
yet tell me not, for i have heard it all. <END>
here's much to do with hate, but more with love. <END>
why, then, o brawling love! o loving hate! <END>
o any thing, of nothing first create! <END>
o heavy lightness! serious vanity! <END>
mis-shapen chaos of well-seeming forms! <END>
feather of lead, bright smoke, cold fire, <END>
sick health! <END>
still-waking sleep, that is not what it is! <END>
this love feel i, that feel no love in this. <END>
dost thou not laugh? <END>
no, coz, i rather weep. <END>
good heart, at what? <END>
at thy good heart's oppression. <END>
why, such is love's transgression. <END>
griefs of mine own lie heavy in my breast, <END>
which thou wilt propagate, to have it prest <END>
with more of thine: this love that thou hast shown <END>
doth add more grief to too much of mine own. <END>
love is a smoke raised with the fume of sighs; <END>
being purged, a fire sparkling in lovers' eyes; <END>
being vex'd a sea nourish'd with lovers' tears: <END>
what is it else? a madness most discreet, <END>
a choking gall and a preserving sweet. <END>
farewell, my coz. <END>
soft! i will go along; <END>
an if you leave me so, you do me wrong. <END>
tut, i have lost myself; i am not here; <END>
this is not romeo, he's some other where. <END>
tell me in sadness, who is that you love. <END>
what, shall i groan and tell thee? <END>
groan! why, no. <END>
but sadly tell me who. <END>
bid a sick man in sadness make his will: <END>
ah, word ill urged to one that is so ill! <END>
in sadness, cousin, i do love a woman. <END>
i aim'd so near, when i supposed you loved. <END>
a right good mark-man! and she's fair i love. <END>
a right fair mark, fair coz, is soonest hit. <END>
well, in that hit you miss: she'll not be hit <END>
with cupid's arrow; she hath dian's wit; <END>
and, in strong proof of chastity well arm'd, <END>
from love's weak childish bow she lives unharm'd. <END>
she will not stay the siege of loving terms, <END>
nor bide the encounter of assailing eyes, <END>
nor ope her lap to saint-seducing gold: <END>
o, she is rich in beauty, only poor, <END>
that when she dies with beauty dies her store. <END>
then she hath sworn that she will still live chaste? <END>
she hath, and in that sparing makes huge waste, <END>
for beauty starved with her severity <END>
cuts beauty off from all posterity. <END>
she is too fair, too wise, wisely too fair, <END>
to merit bliss by making me despair: <END>
she hath forsworn to love, and in that vow <END>
do i live dead that live to tell it now. <END>
be ruled by me, forget to think of her. <END>
o, teach me how i should forget to think. <END>
by giving liberty unto thine eyes; <END>
examine other beauties. <END>
'tis the way <END>
to call hers exquisite, in question more: <END>
these happy masks that kiss fair ladies' brows <END>
being black put us in mind they hide the fair; <END>
he that is strucken blind cannot forget <END>
the precious treasure of his eyesight lost: <END>
show me a mistress that is passing fair, <END>
what doth her beauty serve, but as a note <END>
where i may read who pass'd that passing fair? <END>
i'll pay that doctrine, or else die in debt. <END>
but montague is bound as well as i, <END>
in penalty alike; and 'tis not hard, i think, <END>
for men so old as we to keep the peace. <END>
of honourable reckoning are you both; <END>
and pity 'tis you lived at odds so long. <END>
but now, my lord, what say you to my suit? <END>
but saying o'er what i have said before: <END>
my child is yet a stranger in the world; <END>
she hath not seen the change of fourteen years, <END>
let two more summers wither in their pride, <END>
ere we may think her ripe to be a bride. <END>
younger than she are happy mothers made. <END>
and too soon marr'd are those so early made. <END>
the earth hath swallow'd all my hopes but she, <END>
she is the hopeful lady of my earth: <END>
but woo her, gentle paris, get her heart, <END>
my will to her consent is but a part; <END>
an she agree, within her scope of choice <END>
lies my consent and fair according voice. <END>
this night i hold an old accustom'd feast, <END>
whereto i have invited many a guest, <END>
such as i love; and you, among the store, <END>
one more, most welcome, makes my number more. <END>
at my poor house look to behold this night <END>
earth-treading stars that make dark heaven light: <END>
such comfort as do lusty young men feel <END>
when well-apparell'd april on the heel <END>
of limping winter treads, even such delight <END>
among fresh female buds shall you this night <END>
inherit at my house; hear all, all see, <END>
and like her most whose merit most shall be: <END>
which on more view, of many mine being one <END>
may stand in number, though in reckoning none, <END>
come, go with me. <END>
go, sirrah, trudge about <END>
through fair verona; find those persons out <END>
whose names are written there, and to them say, <END>
my house and welcome on their pleasure stay. <END>
find them out whose names are written here! it is <END>
written, that the shoemaker should meddle with his <END>
yard, and the tailor with his last, the fisher with <END>
his pencil, and the painter with his nets; but i am <END>
sent to find those persons whose names are here <END>
writ, and can never find what names the writing <END>
person hath here writ. i must to the learned.--in good time. <END>
tut, man, one fire burns out another's burning, <END>
one pain is lessen'd by another's anguish; <END>
turn giddy, and be holp by backward turning; <END>
one desperate grief cures with another's languish: <END>
take thou some new infection to thy eye, <END>
and the rank poison of the old will die. <END>
your plaintain-leaf is excellent for that. <END>
for what, i pray thee? <END>
for your broken shin. <END>
why, romeo, art thou mad? <END>
not mad, but bound more than a mad-man is; <END>
shut up in prison, kept without my food, <END>
whipp'd and tormented and--god-den, good fellow. <END>
god gi' god-den. i pray, sir, can you read? <END>
ay, mine own fortune in my misery. <END>
perhaps you have learned it without book: but, i <END>
pray, can you read any thing you see? <END>
ay, if i know the letters and the language. <END>
ye say honestly: rest you merry! <END>
stay, fellow; i can read. <END>
'signior martino and his wife and daughters; <END>
county anselme and his beauteous sisters; the lady <END>
widow of vitravio; signior placentio and his lovely <END>
nieces; mercutio and his brother valentine; mine <END>
uncle capulet, his wife and daughters; my fair niece <END>
rosaline; livia; signior valentio and his cousin <END>
tybalt, lucio and the lively helena.' a fair <END>
assembly: whither should they come? <END>
up. <END>
whither? <END>
to supper; to our house. <END>
whose house? <END>
my master's. <END>
indeed, i should have ask'd you that before. <END>
now i'll tell you without asking: my master is the <END>
great rich capulet; and if you be not of the house <END>
of montagues, i pray, come and crush a cup of wine. <END>
rest you merry! <END>
at this same ancient feast of capulet's <END>
sups the fair rosaline whom thou so lovest, <END>
with all the admired beauties of verona: <END>
go thither; and, with unattainted eye, <END>
compare her face with some that i shall show, <END>
and i will make thee think thy swan a crow. <END>
when the devout religion of mine eye <END>
maintains such falsehood, then turn tears to fires; <END>
and these, who often drown'd could never die, <END>
transparent heretics, be burnt for liars! <END>
one fairer than my love! the all-seeing sun <END>
ne'er saw her match since first the world begun. <END>
tut, you saw her fair, none else being by, <END>
herself poised with herself in either eye: <END>
but in that crystal scales let there be weigh'd <END>
your lady's love against some other maid <END>
that i will show you shining at this feast, <END>
and she shall scant show well that now shows best. <END>
i'll go along, no such sight to be shown, <END>
but to rejoice in splendor of mine own. <END>
nurse, where's my daughter? call her forth to me. <END>
now, by my maidenhead, at twelve year old, <END>
i bade her come. what, lamb! what, ladybird! <END>
god forbid! where's this girl? what, juliet! <END>
how now! who calls? <END>
your mother. <END>
madam, i am here. <END>
what is your will? <END>
this is the matter:--nurse, give leave awhile, <END>
we must talk in secret:--nurse, come back again; <END>
i have remember'd me, thou's hear our counsel. <END>
thou know'st my daughter's of a pretty age. <END>
faith, i can tell her age unto an hour. <END>
she's not fourteen. <END>
i'll lay fourteen of my teeth,-- <END>
and yet, to my teeth be it spoken, i have but four-- <END>
she is not fourteen. how long is it now <END>
to lammas-tide? <END>
a fortnight and odd days. <END>
even or odd, of all days in the year, <END>
come lammas-eve at night shall she be fourteen. <END>
susan and she--god rest all christian souls!-- <END>
were of an age: well, susan is with god; <END>
she was too good for me: but, as i said, <END>
on lammas-eve at night shall she be fourteen; <END>
that shall she, marry; i remember it well. <END>
'tis since the earthquake now eleven years; <END>
and she was wean'd,--i never shall forget it,-- <END>
of all the days of the year, upon that day: <END>
for i had then laid wormwood to my dug, <END>
sitting in the sun under the dove-house wall; <END>
my lord and you were then at mantua:-- <END>
nay, i do bear a brain:--but, as i said, <END>
when it did taste the wormwood on the nipple <END>
of my dug and felt it bitter, pretty fool, <END>
to see it tetchy and fall out with the dug! <END>
shake quoth the dove-house: 'twas no need, i trow, <END>
to bid me trudge: <END>
and since that time it is eleven years; <END>
for then she could stand alone; nay, by the rood, <END>
she could have run and waddled all about; <END>
for even the day before, she broke her brow: <END>
and then my husband--god be with his soul! <END>
a' was a merry man--took up the child: <END>
'yea,' quoth he, 'dost thou fall upon thy face? <END>
thou wilt fall backward when thou hast more wit; <END>
wilt thou not, jule?' and, by my holidame, <END>
the pretty wretch left crying and said 'ay.' <END>
to see, now, how a jest shall come about! <END>
i warrant, an i should live a thousand years, <END>
i never should forget it: 'wilt thou not, jule?' quoth he; <END>
and, pretty fool, it stinted and said 'ay.' <END>
enough of this; i pray thee, hold thy peace. <END>
yes, madam: yet i cannot choose but laugh, <END>
to think it should leave crying and say 'ay.' <END>
and yet, i warrant, it had upon its brow <END>
a bump as big as a young cockerel's stone; <END>
a parlous knock; and it cried bitterly: <END>
'yea,' quoth my husband,'fall'st upon thy face? <END>
thou wilt fall backward when thou comest to age; <END>
wilt thou not, jule?' it stinted and said 'ay.' <END>
and stint thou too, i pray thee, nurse, say i. <END>
peace, i have done. god mark thee to his grace! <END>
thou wast the prettiest babe that e'er i nursed: <END>
an i might live to see thee married once, <END>
i have my wish. <END>
marry, that 'marry' is the very theme <END>
i came to talk of. tell me, daughter juliet, <END>
how stands your disposition to be married? <END>
it is an honour that i dream not of. <END>
an honour! were not i thine only nurse, <END>
i would say thou hadst suck'd wisdom from thy teat. <END>
well, think of marriage now; younger than you, <END>
here in verona, ladies of esteem, <END>
are made already mothers: by my count, <END>
i was your mother much upon these years <END>
that you are now a maid. thus then in brief: <END>
the valiant paris seeks you for his love. <END>
a man, young lady! lady, such a man <END>
as all the world--why, he's a man of wax. <END>
verona's summer hath not such a flower. <END>
nay, he's a flower; in faith, a very flower. <END>
what say you? can you love the gentleman? <END>
this night you shall behold him at our feast; <END>
read o'er the volume of young paris' face, <END>
and find delight writ there with beauty's pen; <END>
examine every married lineament, <END>
and see how one another lends content <END>
and what obscured in this fair volume lies <END>
find written in the margent of his eyes. <END>
this precious book of love, this unbound lover, <END>
to beautify him, only lacks a cover: <END>
the fish lives in the sea, and 'tis much pride <END>
for fair without the fair within to hide: <END>
that book in many's eyes doth share the glory, <END>
that in gold clasps locks in the golden story; <END>
so shall you share all that he doth possess, <END>
by having him, making yourself no less. <END>
no less! nay, bigger; women grow by men. <END>
speak briefly, can you like of paris' love? <END>
i'll look to like, if looking liking move: <END>
but no more deep will i endart mine eye <END>
than your consent gives strength to make it fly. <END>
madam, the guests are come, supper served up, you <END>
called, my young lady asked for, the nurse cursed in <END>
the pantry, and every thing in extremity. i must <END>
hence to wait; i beseech you, follow straight. <END>
we follow thee. <END>
juliet, the county stays. <END>
go, girl, seek happy nights to happy days. <END>
what, shall this speech be spoke for our excuse? <END>
or shall we on without a apology? <END>
the date is out of such prolixity: <END>
we'll have no cupid hoodwink'd with a scarf, <END>
bearing a tartar's painted bow of lath, <END>
scaring the ladies like a crow-keeper; <END>
nor no without-book prologue, faintly spoke <END>
after the prompter, for our entrance: <END>
but let them measure us by what they will; <END>
we'll measure them a measure, and be gone. <END>
give me a torch: i am not for this ambling; <END>
being but heavy, i will bear the light. <END>
nay, gentle romeo, we must have you dance. <END>
not i, believe me: you have dancing shoes <END>
with nimble soles: i have a soul of lead <END>
so stakes me to the ground i cannot move. <END>
you are a lover; borrow cupid's wings, <END>
and soar with them above a common bound. <END>
i am too sore enpierced with his shaft <END>
to soar with his light feathers, and so bound, <END>
i cannot bound a pitch above dull woe: <END>
under love's heavy burden do i sink. <END>
and, to sink in it, should you burden love; <END>
too great oppression for a tender thing. <END>
is love a tender thing? it is too rough, <END>
too rude, too boisterous, and it pricks like thorn. <END>
if love be rough with you, be rough with love; <END>
prick love for pricking, and you beat love down. <END>
give me a case to put my visage in: <END>
a visor for a visor! what care i <END>
what curious eye doth quote deformities? <END>
here are the beetle brows shall blush for me. <END>
come, knock and enter; and no sooner in, <END>
but every man betake him to his legs. <END>
a torch for me: let wantons light of heart <END>
tickle the senseless rushes with their heels, <END>
for i am proverb'd with a grandsire phrase; <END>
i'll be a candle-holder, and look on. <END>
the game was ne'er so fair, and i am done. <END>
tut, dun's the mouse, the constable's own word: <END>
if thou art dun, we'll draw thee from the mire <END>
of this sir-reverence love, wherein thou stick'st <END>
up to the ears. come, we burn daylight, ho! <END>
nay, that's not so. <END>
i mean, sir, in delay <END>
we waste our lights in vain, like lamps by day. <END>
take our good meaning, for our judgment sits <END>
five times in that ere once in our five wits. <END>
and we mean well in going to this mask; <END>
but 'tis no wit to go. <END>
why, may one ask? <END>
i dream'd a dream to-night. <END>
and so did i. <END>
well, what was yours? <END>
that dreamers often lie. <END>
in bed asleep, while they do dream things true. <END>
o, then, i see queen mab hath been with you. <END>
she is the fairies' midwife, and she comes <END>
in shape no bigger than an agate-stone <END>
on the fore-finger of an alderman, <END>
drawn with a team of little atomies <END>
athwart men's noses as they lie asleep; <END>
her wagon-spokes made of long spiders' legs, <END>
the cover of the wings of grasshoppers, <END>
the traces of the smallest spider's web, <END>
the collars of the moonshine's watery beams, <END>
her whip of cricket's bone, the lash of film, <END>
her wagoner a small grey-coated gnat, <END>
not so big as a round little worm <END>
prick'd from the lazy finger of a maid; <END>
her chariot is an empty hazel-nut <END>
made by the joiner squirrel or old grub, <END>
time out o' mind the fairies' coachmakers. <END>
and in this state she gallops night by night <END>
through lovers' brains, and then they dream of love; <END>
o'er courtiers' knees, that dream on court'sies straight, <END>
o'er lawyers' fingers, who straight dream on fees, <END>
o'er ladies ' lips, who straight on kisses dream, <END>
which oft the angry mab with blisters plagues, <END>
because their breaths with sweetmeats tainted are: <END>
sometime she gallops o'er a courtier's nose, <END>
and then dreams he of smelling out a suit; <END>
and sometime comes she with a tithe-pig's tail <END>
tickling a parson's nose as a' lies asleep, <END>
then dreams, he of another benefice: <END>
sometime she driveth o'er a soldier's neck, <END>
and then dreams he of cutting foreign throats, <END>
of breaches, ambuscadoes, spanish blades, <END>
of healths five-fathom deep; and then anon <END>
drums in his ear, at which he starts and wakes, <END>
and being thus frighted swears a prayer or two <END>
and sleeps again. this is that very mab <END>
that plats the manes of horses in the night, <END>
and bakes the elflocks in foul sluttish hairs, <END>
which once untangled, much misfortune bodes: <END>
this is the hag, when maids lie on their backs, <END>
that presses them and learns them first to bear, <END>
making them women of good carriage: <END>
this is she-- <END>
peace, peace, mercutio, peace! <END>
thou talk'st of nothing. <END>
true, i talk of dreams, <END>
which are the children of an idle brain, <END>
begot of nothing but vain fantasy, <END>
which is as thin of substance as the air <END>
and more inconstant than the wind, who wooes <END>
even now the frozen bosom of the north, <END>
and, being anger'd, puffs away from thence, <END>
turning his face to the dew-dropping south. <END>
this wind, you talk of, blows us from ourselves; <END>
supper is done, and we shall come too late. <END>
i fear, too early: for my mind misgives <END>
some consequence yet hanging in the stars <END>
shall bitterly begin his fearful date <END>
with this night's revels and expire the term <END>
of a despised life closed in my breast <END>
by some vile forfeit of untimely death. <END>
but he, that hath the steerage of my course, <END>
direct my sail! on, lusty gentlemen. <END>
strike, drum. <END>
where's potpan, that he helps not to take away? he <END>
shift a trencher? he scrape a trencher! <END>
when good manners shall lie all in one or two men's <END>
hands and they unwashed too, 'tis a foul thing. <END>
away with the joint-stools, remove the <END>
court-cupboard, look to the plate. good thou, save <END>
me a piece of marchpane; and, as thou lovest me, let <END>
the porter let in susan grindstone and nell. <END>
antony, and potpan! <END>
ay, boy, ready. <END>
you are looked for and called for, asked for and <END>
sought for, in the great chamber. <END>
we cannot be here and there too. cheerly, boys; be <END>
brisk awhile, and the longer liver take all. <END>
welcome, gentlemen! ladies that have their toes <END>
unplagued with corns will have a bout with you. <END>
ah ha, my mistresses! which of you all <END>
will now deny to dance? she that makes dainty, <END>
she, i'll swear, hath corns; am i come near ye now? <END>
welcome, gentlemen! i have seen the day <END>
that i have worn a visor and could tell <END>
a whispering tale in a fair lady's ear, <END>
such as would please: 'tis gone, 'tis gone, 'tis gone: <END>
you are welcome, gentlemen! come, musicians, play. <END>
a hall, a hall! give room! and foot it, girls. <END>
more light, you knaves; and turn the tables up, <END>
and quench the fire, the room is grown too hot. <END>
ah, sirrah, this unlook'd-for sport comes well. <END>
nay, sit, nay, sit, good cousin capulet; <END>
for you and i are past our dancing days: <END>
how long is't now since last yourself and i <END>
were in a mask? <END>
by'r lady, thirty years. <END>
what, man! 'tis not so much, 'tis not so much: <END>
'tis since the nuptials of lucentio, <END>
come pentecost as quickly as it will, <END>
some five and twenty years; and then we mask'd. <END>
'tis more, 'tis more, his son is elder, sir; <END>
his son is thirty. <END>
will you tell me that? <END>
his son was but a ward two years ago. <END>
i know not, sir. <END>
o, she doth teach the torches to burn bright! <END>
it seems she hangs upon the cheek of night <END>
like a rich jewel in an ethiope's ear; <END>
beauty too rich for use, for earth too dear! <END>
so shows a snowy dove trooping with crows, <END>
as yonder lady o'er her fellows shows. <END>
the measure done, i'll watch her place of stand, <END>
and, touching hers, make blessed my rude hand. <END>
did my heart love till now? forswear it, sight! <END>
for i ne'er saw true beauty till this night. <END>
this, by his voice, should be a montague. <END>
fetch me my rapier, boy. what dares the slave <END>
come hither, cover'd with an antic face, <END>
to fleer and scorn at our solemnity? <END>
now, by the stock and honour of my kin, <END>
to strike him dead, i hold it not a sin. <END>
why, how now, kinsman! wherefore storm you so? <END>
uncle, this is a montague, our foe, <END>
a villain that is hither come in spite, <END>
to scorn at our solemnity this night. <END>
young romeo is it? <END>
'tis he, that villain romeo. <END>
content thee, gentle coz, let him alone; <END>
he bears him like a portly gentleman; <END>
and, to say truth, verona brags of him <END>
to be a virtuous and well-govern'd youth: <END>
i would not for the wealth of all the town <END>
here in my house do him disparagement: <END>
therefore be patient, take no note of him: <END>
it is my will, the which if thou respect, <END>
show a fair presence and put off these frowns, <END>
and ill-beseeming semblance for a feast. <END>
it fits, when such a villain is a guest: <END>
i'll not endure him. <END>
he shall be endured: <END>
what, goodman boy! i say, he shall: go to; <END>
am i the master here, or you? go to. <END>
you'll not endure him! god shall mend my soul! <END>
you'll make a mutiny among my guests! <END>
you will set cock-a-hoop! you'll be the man! <END>
why, uncle, 'tis a shame. <END>
go to, go to; <END>
you are a saucy boy: is't so, indeed? <END>
this trick may chance to scathe you, i know what: <END>
you must contrary me! marry, 'tis time. <END>
well said, my hearts! you are a princox; go: <END>
be quiet, or--more light, more light! for shame! <END>
i'll make you quiet. what, cheerly, my hearts! <END>
patience perforce with wilful choler meeting <END>
makes my flesh tremble in their different greeting. <END>
i will withdraw: but this intrusion shall <END>
now seeming sweet convert to bitter gall. <END>
good pilgrim, you do wrong your hand too much, <END>
which mannerly devotion shows in this; <END>
for saints have hands that pilgrims' hands do touch, <END>
and palm to palm is holy palmers' kiss. <END>
have not saints lips, and holy palmers too? <END>
ay, pilgrim, lips that they must use in prayer. <END>
o, then, dear saint, let lips do what hands do; <END>
they pray, grant thou, lest faith turn to despair. <END>
saints do not move, though grant for prayers' sake. <END>
then move not, while my prayer's effect i take. <END>
thus from my lips, by yours, my sin is purged. <END>
then have my lips the sin that they have took. <END>
sin from thy lips? o trespass sweetly urged! <END>
give me my sin again. <END>
you kiss by the book. <END>
madam, your mother craves a word with you. <END>
what is her mother? <END>
marry, bachelor, <END>
her mother is the lady of the house, <END>
and a good lady, and a wise and virtuous <END>
i nursed her daughter, that you talk'd withal; <END>
i tell you, he that can lay hold of her <END>
shall have the chinks. <END>
is she a capulet? <END>
o dear account! my life is my foe's debt. <END>
away, begone; the sport is at the best. <END>
ay, so i fear; the more is my unrest. <END>
nay, gentlemen, prepare not to be gone; <END>
we have a trifling foolish banquet towards. <END>
is it e'en so? why, then, i thank you all <END>
i thank you, honest gentlemen; good night. <END>
more torches here! come on then, let's to bed. <END>
ah, sirrah, by my fay, it waxes late: <END>
i'll to my rest. <END>
come hither, nurse. what is yond gentleman? <END>
the son and heir of old tiberio. <END>
what's he that now is going out of door? <END>
marry, that, i think, be young petrucio. <END>
what's he that follows there, that would not dance? <END>
i know not. <END>
go ask his name: if he be married. <END>
my grave is like to be my wedding bed. <END>
his name is romeo, and a montague; <END>
the only son of your great enemy. <END>
my only love sprung from my only hate! <END>
too early seen unknown, and known too late! <END>
prodigious birth of love it is to me, <END>
that i must love a loathed enemy. <END>
what's this? what's this? <END>
a rhyme i learn'd even now <END>
of one i danced withal. <END>
anon, anon! <END>
come, let's away; the strangers all are gone. <END>
now old desire doth in his death-bed lie, <END>
and young affection gapes to be his heir; <END>
that fair for which love groan'd for and would die, <END>
with tender juliet match'd, is now not fair. <END>
now romeo is beloved and loves again, <END>
alike betwitched by the charm of looks, <END>
but to his foe supposed he must complain, <END>
and she steal love's sweet bait from fearful hooks: <END>
being held a foe, he may not have access <END>
to breathe such vows as lovers use to swear; <END>
and she as much in love, her means much less <END>
to meet her new-beloved any where: <END>
but passion lends them power, time means, to meet <END>
tempering extremities with extreme sweet. <END>
can i go forward when my heart is here? <END>
turn back, dull earth, and find thy centre out. <END>
romeo! my cousin romeo! <END>
he is wise; <END>
and, on my lie, hath stol'n him home to bed. <END>
he ran this way, and leap'd this orchard wall: <END>
call, good mercutio. <END>
nay, i'll conjure too. <END>
romeo! humours! madman! passion! lover! <END>
appear thou in the likeness of a sigh: <END>
speak but one rhyme, and i am satisfied; <END>
cry but 'ay me!' pronounce but 'love' and 'dove;' <END>
speak to my gossip venus one fair word, <END>
one nick-name for her purblind son and heir, <END>
young adam cupid, he that shot so trim, <END>
when king cophetua loved the beggar-maid! <END>
he heareth not, he stirreth not, he moveth not; <END>
the ape is dead, and i must conjure him. <END>
i conjure thee by rosaline's bright eyes, <END>
by her high forehead and her scarlet lip, <END>
by her fine foot, straight leg and quivering thigh <END>
and the demesnes that there adjacent lie, <END>
that in thy likeness thou appear to us! <END>
and if he hear thee, thou wilt anger him. <END>
this cannot anger him: 'twould anger him <END>
to raise a spirit in his mistress' circle <END>
of some strange nature, letting it there stand <END>
till she had laid it and conjured it down; <END>
that were some spite: my invocation <END>
is fair and honest, and in his mistress' name <END>
i conjure only but to raise up him. <END>
come, he hath hid himself among these trees, <END>
to be consorted with the humorous night: <END>
blind is his love and best befits the dark. <END>
if love be blind, love cannot hit the mark. <END>
now will he sit under a medlar tree, <END>
and wish his mistress were that kind of fruit <END>
as maids call medlars, when they laugh alone. <END>
romeo, that she were, o, that she were <END>
an open et caetera, thou a poperin pear! <END>
romeo, good night: i'll to my truckle-bed; <END>
this field-bed is too cold for me to sleep: <END>
come, shall we go? <END>
go, then; for 'tis in vain <END>
to seek him here that means not to be found. <END>
he jests at scars that never felt a wound. <END>
but, soft! what light through yonder window breaks? <END>
it is the east, and juliet is the sun. <END>
arise, fair sun, and kill the envious moon, <END>
who is already sick and pale with grief, <END>
that thou her maid art far more fair than she: <END>
be not her maid, since she is envious; <END>
her vestal livery is but sick and green <END>
and none but fools do wear it; cast it off. <END>
it is my lady, o, it is my love! <END>
o, that she knew she were! <END>
she speaks yet she says nothing: what of that? <END>
her eye discourses; i will answer it. <END>
i am too bold, 'tis not to me she speaks: <END>
two of the fairest stars in all the heaven, <END>
having some business, do entreat her eyes <END>
to twinkle in their spheres till they return. <END>
what if her eyes were there, they in her head? <END>
the brightness of her cheek would shame those stars, <END>
as daylight doth a lamp; her eyes in heaven <END>
would through the airy region stream so bright <END>
that birds would sing and think it were not night. <END>
see, how she leans her cheek upon her hand! <END>
o, that i were a glove upon that hand, <END>
that i might touch that cheek! <END>
ay me! <END>
she speaks: <END>
o, speak again, bright angel! for thou art <END>
as glorious to this night, being o'er my head <END>
as is a winged messenger of heaven <END>
unto the white-upturned wondering eyes <END>
of mortals that fall back to gaze on him <END>
when he bestrides the lazy-pacing clouds <END>
and sails upon the bosom of the air. <END>
o romeo, romeo! wherefore art thou romeo? <END>
deny thy father and refuse thy name; <END>
or, if thou wilt not, be but sworn my love, <END>
and i'll no longer be a capulet. <END>
'tis but thy name that is my enemy; <END>
thou art thyself, though not a montague. <END>
what's montague? it is nor hand, nor foot, <END>
nor arm, nor face, nor any other part <END>
belonging to a man. o, be some other name! <END>
what's in a name? that which we call a rose <END>
by any other name would smell as sweet; <END>
so romeo would, were he not romeo call'd, <END>
retain that dear perfection which he owes <END>
without that title. romeo, doff thy name, <END>
and for that name which is no part of thee <END>
take all myself. <END>
i take thee at thy word: <END>
call me but love, and i'll be new baptized; <END>
henceforth i never will be romeo. <END>
what man art thou that thus bescreen'd in night <END>
so stumblest on my counsel? <END>
by a name <END>
i know not how to tell thee who i am: <END>
my name, dear saint, is hateful to myself, <END>
because it is an enemy to thee; <END>
had i it written, i would tear the word. <END>
my ears have not yet drunk a hundred words <END>
of that tongue's utterance, yet i know the sound: <END>
art thou not romeo and a montague? <END>
neither, fair saint, if either thee dislike. <END>
how camest thou hither, tell me, and wherefore? <END>
the orchard walls are high and hard to climb, <END>
and the place death, considering who thou art, <END>
if any of my kinsmen find thee here. <END>
with love's light wings did i o'er-perch these walls; <END>
for stony limits cannot hold love out, <END>
and what love can do that dares love attempt; <END>
therefore thy kinsmen are no let to me. <END>
if they do see thee, they will murder thee. <END>
alack, there lies more peril in thine eye <END>
than twenty of their swords: look thou but sweet, <END>
and i am proof against their enmity. <END>
i would not for the world they saw thee here. <END>
i have night's cloak to hide me from their sight; <END>
and but thou love me, let them find me here: <END>
my life were better ended by their hate, <END>
than death prorogued, wanting of thy love. <END>
by whose direction found'st thou out this place? <END>
by love, who first did prompt me to inquire; <END>
he lent me counsel and i lent him eyes. <END>
i am no pilot; yet, wert thou as far <END>
as that vast shore wash'd with the farthest sea, <END>
i would adventure for such merchandise. <END>
thou know'st the mask of night is on my face, <END>
else would a maiden blush bepaint my cheek <END>
for that which thou hast heard me speak to-night <END>
fain would i dwell on form, fain, fain deny <END>
what i have spoke: but farewell compliment! <END>
dost thou love me? i know thou wilt say 'ay,' <END>
and i will take thy word: yet if thou swear'st, <END>
thou mayst prove false; at lovers' perjuries <END>
then say, jove laughs. o gentle romeo, <END>
if thou dost love, pronounce it faithfully: <END>
or if thou think'st i am too quickly won, <END>
i'll frown and be perverse an say thee nay, <END>
so thou wilt woo; but else, not for the world. <END>
in truth, fair montague, i am too fond, <END>
and therefore thou mayst think my 'havior light: <END>
but trust me, gentleman, i'll prove more true <END>
than those that have more cunning to be strange. <END>
i should have been more strange, i must confess, <END>
but that thou overheard'st, ere i was ware, <END>
my true love's passion: therefore pardon me, <END>
and not impute this yielding to light love, <END>
which the dark night hath so discovered. <END>
lady, by yonder blessed moon i swear <END>
that tips with silver all these fruit-tree tops-- <END>
o, swear not by the moon, the inconstant moon, <END>
that monthly changes in her circled orb, <END>
lest that thy love prove likewise variable. <END>
what shall i swear by? <END>
do not swear at all; <END>
or, if thou wilt, swear by thy gracious self, <END>
which is the god of my idolatry, <END>
and i'll believe thee. <END>
if my heart's dear love-- <END>
well, do not swear: although i joy in thee, <END>
i have no joy of this contract to-night: <END>
it is too rash, too unadvised, too sudden; <END>
too like the lightning, which doth cease to be <END>
ere one can say 'it lightens.' sweet, good night! <END>
this bud of love, by summer's ripening breath, <END>
may prove a beauteous flower when next we meet. <END>
good night, good night! as sweet repose and rest <END>
come to thy heart as that within my breast! <END>
o, wilt thou leave me so unsatisfied? <END>
what satisfaction canst thou have to-night? <END>
the exchange of thy love's faithful vow for mine. <END>
i gave thee mine before thou didst request it: <END>
and yet i would it were to give again. <END>
wouldst thou withdraw it? for what purpose, love? <END>
but to be frank, and give it thee again. <END>
and yet i wish but for the thing i have: <END>
my bounty is as boundless as the sea, <END>
my love as deep; the more i give to thee, <END>
the more i have, for both are infinite. <END>
i hear some noise within; dear love, adieu! <END>
anon, good nurse! sweet montague, be true. <END>
stay but a little, i will come again. <END>
o blessed, blessed night! i am afeard. <END>
being in night, all this is but a dream, <END>
too flattering-sweet to be substantial. <END>
three words, dear romeo, and good night indeed. <END>
if that thy bent of love be honourable, <END>
thy purpose marriage, send me word to-morrow, <END>
by one that i'll procure to come to thee, <END>
where and what time thou wilt perform the rite; <END>
and all my fortunes at thy foot i'll lay <END>
and follow thee my lord throughout the world. <END>
i come, anon.--but if thou mean'st not well, <END>
i do beseech thee-- <END>
by and by, i come:-- <END>
to cease thy suit, and leave me to my grief: <END>
to-morrow will i send. <END>
so thrive my soul-- <END>
a thousand times good night! <END>
a thousand times the worse, to want thy light. <END>
love goes toward love, as schoolboys from <END>
their books, <END>
but love from love, toward school with heavy looks. <END>
hist! romeo, hist! o, for a falconer's voice, <END>
to lure this tassel-gentle back again! <END>
bondage is hoarse, and may not speak aloud; <END>
else would i tear the cave where echo lies, <END>
and make her airy tongue more hoarse than mine, <END>
with repetition of my romeo's name. <END>
it is my soul that calls upon my name: <END>
how silver-sweet sound lovers' tongues by night, <END>
like softest music to attending ears! <END>
romeo! <END>
my dear? <END>
at what o'clock to-morrow <END>
shall i send to thee? <END>
at the hour of nine. <END>
i will not fail: 'tis twenty years till then. <END>
i have forgot why i did call thee back. <END>
let me stand here till thou remember it. <END>
i shall forget, to have thee still stand there, <END>
remembering how i love thy company. <END>
and i'll still stay, to have thee still forget, <END>
forgetting any other home but this. <END>
'tis almost morning; i would have thee gone: <END>
and yet no further than a wanton's bird; <END>
who lets it hop a little from her hand, <END>
like a poor prisoner in his twisted gyves, <END>
and with a silk thread plucks it back again, <END>
so loving-jealous of his liberty. <END>
i would i were thy bird. <END>
sweet, so would i: <END>
yet i should kill thee with much cherishing. <END>
good night, good night! parting is such <END>
sweet sorrow, <END>
that i shall say good night till it be morrow. <END>
sleep dwell upon thine eyes, peace in thy breast! <END>
would i were sleep and peace, so sweet to rest! <END>
hence will i to my ghostly father's cell, <END>
his help to crave, and my dear hap to tell. <END>
the grey-eyed morn smiles on the frowning night, <END>
chequering the eastern clouds with streaks of light, <END>
and flecked darkness like a drunkard reels <END>
from forth day's path and titan's fiery wheels: <END>
now, ere the sun advance his burning eye, <END>
the day to cheer and night's dank dew to dry, <END>
i must up-fill this osier cage of ours <END>
with baleful weeds and precious-juiced flowers. <END>
the earth that's nature's mother is her tomb; <END>
what is her burying grave that is her womb, <END>
and from her womb children of divers kind <END>
we sucking on her natural bosom find, <END>
many for many virtues excellent, <END>
none but for some and yet all different. <END>
o, mickle is the powerful grace that lies <END>
in herbs, plants, stones, and their true qualities: <END>
for nought so vile that on the earth doth live <END>
but to the earth some special good doth give, <END>
nor aught so good but strain'd from that fair use <END>
revolts from true birth, stumbling on abuse: <END>
virtue itself turns vice, being misapplied; <END>
and vice sometimes by action dignified. <END>
within the infant rind of this small flower <END>
poison hath residence and medicine power: <END>
for this, being smelt, with that part cheers each part; <END>
being tasted, slays all senses with the heart. <END>
two such opposed kings encamp them still <END>
in man as well as herbs, grace and rude will; <END>
and where the worser is predominant, <END>
full soon the canker death eats up that plant. <END>
good morrow, father. <END>
benedicite! <END>
what early tongue so sweet saluteth me? <END>
young son, it argues a distemper'd head <END>
so soon to bid good morrow to thy bed: <END>
care keeps his watch in every old man's eye, <END>
and where care lodges, sleep will never lie; <END>
but where unbruised youth with unstuff'd brain <END>
doth couch his limbs, there golden sleep doth reign: <END>
therefore thy earliness doth me assure <END>
thou art up-roused by some distemperature; <END>
or if not so, then here i hit it right, <END>
our romeo hath not been in bed to-night. <END>
that last is true; the sweeter rest was mine. <END>
god pardon sin! wast thou with rosaline? <END>
with rosaline, my ghostly father? no; <END>
i have forgot that name, and that name's woe. <END>
that's my good son: but where hast thou been, then? <END>
i'll tell thee, ere thou ask it me again. <END>
i have been feasting with mine enemy, <END>
where on a sudden one hath wounded me, <END>
that's by me wounded: both our remedies <END>
within thy help and holy physic lies: <END>
i bear no hatred, blessed man, for, lo, <END>
my intercession likewise steads my foe. <END>
be plain, good son, and homely in thy drift; <END>
riddling confession finds but riddling shrift. <END>
then plainly know my heart's dear love is set <END>
on the fair daughter of rich capulet: <END>
as mine on hers, so hers is set on mine; <END>
and all combined, save what thou must combine <END>
by holy marriage: when and where and how <END>
we met, we woo'd and made exchange of vow, <END>
i'll tell thee as we pass; but this i pray, <END>
that thou consent to marry us to-day. <END>
holy saint francis, what a change is here! <END>
is rosaline, whom thou didst love so dear, <END>
so soon forsaken? young men's love then lies <END>
not truly in their hearts, but in their eyes. <END>
jesu maria, what a deal of brine <END>
hath wash'd thy sallow cheeks for rosaline! <END>
how much salt water thrown away in waste, <END>
to season love, that of it doth not taste! <END>
the sun not yet thy sighs from heaven clears, <END>
thy old groans ring yet in my ancient ears; <END>
lo, here upon thy cheek the stain doth sit <END>
of an old tear that is not wash'd off yet: <END>
if e'er thou wast thyself and these woes thine, <END>
thou and these woes were all for rosaline: <END>
and art thou changed? pronounce this sentence then, <END>
women may fall, when there's no strength in men. <END>
thou chid'st me oft for loving rosaline. <END>
for doting, not for loving, pupil mine. <END>
and bad'st me bury love. <END>
not in a grave, <END>
to lay one in, another out to have. <END>
i pray thee, chide not; she whom i love now <END>
doth grace for grace and love for love allow; <END>
the other did not so. <END>
o, she knew well <END>
thy love did read by rote and could not spell. <END>
but come, young waverer, come, go with me, <END>
in one respect i'll thy assistant be; <END>
for this alliance may so happy prove, <END>
to turn your households' rancour to pure love. <END>
o, let us hence; i stand on sudden haste. <END>
wisely and slow; they stumble that run fast. <END>
where the devil should this romeo be? <END>
came he not home to-night? <END>
not to his father's; i spoke with his man. <END>
ah, that same pale hard-hearted wench, that rosaline. <END>
torments him so, that he will sure run mad. <END>
tybalt, the kinsman of old capulet, <END>
hath sent a letter to his father's house. <END>
a challenge, on my life. <END>
romeo will answer it. <END>
any man that can write may answer a letter. <END>
nay, he will answer the letter's master, how he <END>
dares, being dared. <END>
alas poor romeo! he is already dead; stabbed with a <END>
white wench's black eye; shot through the ear with a <END>
love-song; the very pin of his heart cleft with the <END>
blind bow-boy's butt-shaft: and is he a man to <END>
encounter tybalt? <END>
why, what is tybalt? <END>
more than prince of cats, i can tell you. o, he is <END>
the courageous captain of compliments. he fights as <END>
you sing prick-song, keeps time, distance, and <END>
proportion; rests me his minim rest, one, two, and <END>
the third in your bosom: the very butcher of a silk <END>
button, a duellist, a duellist; a gentleman of the <END>
very first house, of the first and second cause: <END>
ah, the immortal passado! the punto reverso! the <END>
hai! <END>
the what? <END>
the pox of such antic, lisping, affecting <END>
fantasticoes; these new tuners of accents! 'by jesu, <END>
a very good blade! a very tall man! a very good <END>
whore!' why, is not this a lamentable thing, <END>
grandsire, that we should be thus afflicted with <END>
these strange flies, these fashion-mongers, these <END>
perdona-mi's, who stand so much on the new form, <END>
that they cannot at ease on the old bench? o, their <END>
bones, their bones! <END>
here comes romeo, here comes romeo. <END>
without his roe, like a dried herring: flesh, flesh, <END>
how art thou fishified! now is he for the numbers <END>
that petrarch flowed in: laura to his lady was but a <END>
kitchen-wench; marry, she had a better love to <END>
be-rhyme her; dido a dowdy; cleopatra a gipsy; <END>
helen and hero hildings and harlots; thisbe a grey <END>
eye or so, but not to the purpose. signior <END>
romeo, bon jour! there's a french salutation <END>
to your french slop. you gave us the counterfeit <END>
fairly last night. <END>
good morrow to you both. what counterfeit did i give you? <END>
the ship, sir, the slip; can you not conceive? <END>
pardon, good mercutio, my business was great; and in <END>
such a case as mine a man may strain courtesy. <END>
that's as much as to say, such a case as yours <END>
constrains a man to bow in the hams. <END>
meaning, to court'sy. <END>
thou hast most kindly hit it. <END>
a most courteous exposition. <END>
nay, i am the very pink of courtesy. <END>
pink for flower. <END>
right. <END>
why, then is my pump well flowered. <END>
well said: follow me this jest now till thou hast <END>
worn out thy pump, that when the single sole of it <END>
is worn, the jest may remain after the wearing sole singular. <END>
o single-soled jest, solely singular for the <END>
singleness. <END>
come between us, good benvolio; my wits faint. <END>
switch and spurs, switch and spurs; or i'll cry a match. <END>
nay, if thy wits run the wild-goose chase, i have <END>
done, for thou hast more of the wild-goose in one of <END>
thy wits than, i am sure, i have in my whole five: <END>
was i with you there for the goose? <END>
thou wast never with me for any thing when thou wast <END>
not there for the goose. <END>
i will bite thee by the ear for that jest. <END>
nay, good goose, bite not. <END>
thy wit is a very bitter sweeting; it is a most <END>
sharp sauce. <END>
and is it not well served in to a sweet goose? <END>
o here's a wit of cheveril, that stretches from an <END>
inch narrow to an ell broad! <END>
i stretch it out for that word 'broad;' which added <END>
to the goose, proves thee far and wide a broad goose. <END>
why, is not this better now than groaning for love? <END>
now art thou sociable, now art thou romeo; now art <END>
thou what thou art, by art as well as by nature: <END>
for this drivelling love is like a great natural, <END>
that runs lolling up and down to hide his bauble in a hole. <END>
stop there, stop there. <END>
thou desirest me to stop in my tale against the hair. <END>
thou wouldst else have made thy tale large. <END>
o, thou art deceived; i would have made it short: <END>
for i was come to the whole depth of my tale; and <END>
meant, indeed, to occupy the argument no longer. <END>
here's goodly gear! <END>
a sail, a sail! <END>
two, two; a shirt and a smock. <END>
peter! <END>
anon! <END>
my fan, peter. <END>
good peter, to hide her face; for her fan's the <END>
fairer face. <END>
god ye good morrow, gentlemen. <END>
god ye good den, fair gentlewoman. <END>
is it good den? <END>
'tis no less, i tell you, for the bawdy hand of the <END>
dial is now upon the prick of noon. <END>
out upon you! what a man are you! <END>
one, gentlewoman, that god hath made for himself to <END>
mar. <END>
by my troth, it is well said; 'for himself to mar,' <END>
quoth a'? gentlemen, can any of you tell me where i <END>
may find the young romeo? <END>
i can tell you; but young romeo will be older when <END>
you have found him than he was when you sought him: <END>
i am the youngest of that name, for fault of a worse. <END>
you say well. <END>
yea, is the worst well? very well took, i' faith; <END>
wisely, wisely. <END>
if you be he, sir, i desire some confidence with <END>
you. <END>
she will indite him to some supper. <END>
a bawd, a bawd, a bawd! so ho! <END>
what hast thou found? <END>
no hare, sir; unless a hare, sir, in a lenten pie, <END>
that is something stale and hoar ere it be spent. <END>
an old hare hoar, <END>
and an old hare hoar, <END>
is very good meat in lent <END>
but a hare that is hoar <END>
is too much for a score, <END>
when it hoars ere it be spent. <END>
romeo, will you come to your father's? we'll <END>
to dinner, thither. <END>
i will follow you. <END>
farewell, ancient lady; farewell, <END>
'lady, lady, lady.' <END>
marry, farewell! i pray you, sir, what saucy <END>
merchant was this, that was so full of his ropery? <END>
a gentleman, nurse, that loves to hear himself talk, <END>
and will speak more in a minute than he will stand <END>
to in a month. <END>
an a' speak any thing against me, i'll take him <END>
down, an a' were lustier than he is, and twenty such <END>
jacks; and if i cannot, i'll find those that shall. <END>
scurvy knave! i am none of his flirt-gills; i am <END>
none of his skains-mates. and thou must stand by <END>
too, and suffer every knave to use me at his pleasure? <END>
i saw no man use you a pleasure; if i had, my weapon <END>
should quickly have been out, i warrant you: i dare <END>
draw as soon as another man, if i see occasion in a <END>
good quarrel, and the law on my side. <END>
now, afore god, i am so vexed, that every part about <END>
me quivers. scurvy knave! pray you, sir, a word: <END>
and as i told you, my young lady bade me inquire you <END>
out; what she bade me say, i will keep to myself: <END>
but first let me tell ye, if ye should lead her into <END>
a fool's paradise, as they say, it were a very gross <END>
kind of behavior, as they say: for the gentlewoman <END>
is young; and, therefore, if you should deal double <END>
with her, truly it were an ill thing to be offered <END>
to any gentlewoman, and very weak dealing. <END>
nurse, commend me to thy lady and mistress. i <END>
protest unto thee-- <END>
good heart, and, i' faith, i will tell her as much: <END>
lord, lord, she will be a joyful woman. <END>
what wilt thou tell her, nurse? thou dost not mark me. <END>
i will tell her, sir, that you do protest; which, as <END>
i take it, is a gentlemanlike offer. <END>
bid her devise <END>
some means to come to shrift this afternoon; <END>
and there she shall at friar laurence' cell <END>
be shrived and married. here is for thy pains. <END>
no truly sir; not a penny. <END>
go to; i say you shall. <END>
this afternoon, sir? well, she shall be there. <END>
and stay, good nurse, behind the abbey wall: <END>
within this hour my man shall be with thee <END>
and bring thee cords made like a tackled stair; <END>
which to the high top-gallant of my joy <END>
must be my convoy in the secret night. <END>
farewell; be trusty, and i'll quit thy pains: <END>
farewell; commend me to thy mistress. <END>
now god in heaven bless thee! hark you, sir. <END>
what say'st thou, my dear nurse? <END>
is your man secret? did you ne'er hear say, <END>
two may keep counsel, putting one away? <END>
i warrant thee, my man's as true as steel. <END>
well, sir; my mistress is the sweetest lady--lord, <END>
lord! when 'twas a little prating thing:--o, there <END>
is a nobleman in town, one paris, that would fain <END>
lay knife aboard; but she, good soul, had as lief <END>
see a toad, a very toad, as see him. i anger her <END>
sometimes and tell her that paris is the properer <END>
man; but, i'll warrant you, when i say so, she looks <END>
as pale as any clout in the versal world. doth not <END>
rosemary and romeo begin both with a letter? <END>
ay, nurse; what of that? both with an r. <END>
ah. mocker! that's the dog's name; r is for <END>
the--no; i know it begins with some other <END>
letter:--and she hath the prettiest sententious of <END>
it, of you and rosemary, that it would do you good <END>
to hear it. <END>
commend me to thy lady. <END>
ay, a thousand times. <END>
peter! <END>
anon! <END>
peter, take my fan, and go before and apace. <END>
the clock struck nine when i did send the nurse; <END>
in half an hour she promised to return. <END>
perchance she cannot meet him: that's not so. <END>
o, she is lame! love's heralds should be thoughts, <END>
which ten times faster glide than the sun's beams, <END>
driving back shadows over louring hills: <END>
therefore do nimble-pinion'd doves draw love, <END>
and therefore hath the wind-swift cupid wings. <END>
now is the sun upon the highmost hill <END>
of this day's journey, and from nine till twelve <END>
is three long hours, yet she is not come. <END>
had she affections and warm youthful blood, <END>
she would be as swift in motion as a ball; <END>
my words would bandy her to my sweet love, <END>
and his to me: <END>
but old folks, many feign as they were dead; <END>
unwieldy, slow, heavy and pale as lead. <END>
o god, she comes! <END>
o honey nurse, what news? <END>
hast thou met with him? send thy man away. <END>
peter, stay at the gate. <END>
now, good sweet nurse,--o lord, why look'st thou sad? <END>
though news be sad, yet tell them merrily; <END>
if good, thou shamest the music of sweet news <END>
by playing it to me with so sour a face. <END>
i am a-weary, give me leave awhile: <END>
fie, how my bones ache! what a jaunt have i had! <END>
i would thou hadst my bones, and i thy news: <END>
nay, come, i pray thee, speak; good, good nurse, speak. <END>
jesu, what haste? can you not stay awhile? <END>
do you not see that i am out of breath? <END>
how art thou out of breath, when thou hast breath <END>
to say to me that thou art out of breath? <END>
the excuse that thou dost make in this delay <END>
is longer than the tale thou dost excuse. <END>
is thy news good, or bad? answer to that; <END>
say either, and i'll stay the circumstance: <END>
let me be satisfied, is't good or bad? <END>
well, you have made a simple choice; you know not <END>
how to choose a man: romeo! no, not he; though his <END>
face be better than any man's, yet his leg excels <END>
all men's; and for a hand, and a foot, and a body, <END>
though they be not to be talked on, yet they are <END>
past compare: he is not the flower of courtesy, <END>
but, i'll warrant him, as gentle as a lamb. go thy <END>
ways, wench; serve god. what, have you dined at home? <END>
no, no: but all this did i know before. <END>
what says he of our marriage? what of that? <END>
lord, how my head aches! what a head have i! <END>
it beats as it would fall in twenty pieces. <END>
my back o' t' other side,--o, my back, my back! <END>
beshrew your heart for sending me about, <END>
to catch my death with jaunting up and down! <END>
i' faith, i am sorry that thou art not well. <END>
sweet, sweet, sweet nurse, tell me, what says my love? <END>
your love says, like an honest gentleman, and a <END>
courteous, and a kind, and a handsome, and, i <END>
warrant, a virtuous,--where is your mother? <END>
where is my mother! why, she is within; <END>
where should she be? how oddly thou repliest! <END>
'your love says, like an honest gentleman, <END>
where is your mother?' <END>
o god's lady dear! <END>
are you so hot? marry, come up, i trow; <END>
is this the poultice for my aching bones? <END>
henceforward do your messages yourself. <END>
here's such a coil! come, what says romeo? <END>
have you got leave to go to shrift to-day? <END>
i have. <END>
then hie you hence to friar laurence' cell; <END>
there stays a husband to make you a wife: <END>
now comes the wanton blood up in your cheeks, <END>
they'll be in scarlet straight at any news. <END>
hie you to church; i must another way, <END>
to fetch a ladder, by the which your love <END>
must climb a bird's nest soon when it is dark: <END>
i am the drudge and toil in your delight, <END>
but you shall bear the burden soon at night. <END>
go; i'll to dinner: hie you to the cell. <END>
hie to high fortune! honest nurse, farewell. <END>
so smile the heavens upon this holy act, <END>
that after hours with sorrow chide us not! <END>
amen, amen! but come what sorrow can, <END>
it cannot countervail the exchange of joy <END>
that one short minute gives me in her sight: <END>
do thou but close our hands with holy words, <END>
then love-devouring death do what he dare; <END>
it is enough i may but call her mine. <END>
these violent delights have violent ends <END>
and in their triumph die, like fire and powder, <END>
which as they kiss consume: the sweetest honey <END>
is loathsome in his own deliciousness <END>
and in the taste confounds the appetite: <END>
therefore love moderately; long love doth so; <END>
too swift arrives as tardy as too slow. <END>
here comes the lady: o, so light a foot <END>
will ne'er wear out the everlasting flint: <END>
a lover may bestride the gossamer <END>
that idles in the wanton summer air, <END>
and yet not fall; so light is vanity. <END>
good even to my ghostly confessor. <END>
romeo shall thank thee, daughter, for us both. <END>
as much to him, else is his thanks too much. <END>
ah, juliet, if the measure of thy joy <END>
be heap'd like mine and that thy skill be more <END>
to blazon it, then sweeten with thy breath <END>
this neighbour air, and let rich music's tongue <END>
unfold the imagined happiness that both <END>
receive in either by this dear encounter. <END>
conceit, more rich in matter than in words, <END>
brags of his substance, not of ornament: <END>
they are but beggars that can count their worth; <END>
but my true love is grown to such excess <END>
i cannot sum up sum of half my wealth. <END>
come, come with me, and we will make short work; <END>
for, by your leaves, you shall not stay alone <END>
till holy church incorporate two in one. <END>
i pray thee, good mercutio, let's retire: <END>
the day is hot, the capulets abroad, <END>
and, if we meet, we shall not scape a brawl; <END>
for now, these hot days, is the mad blood stirring. <END>
thou art like one of those fellows that when he <END>
enters the confines of a tavern claps me his sword <END>
upon the table and says 'god send me no need of <END>
thee!' and by the operation of the second cup draws <END>
it on the drawer, when indeed there is no need. <END>
am i like such a fellow? <END>
come, come, thou art as hot a jack in thy mood as <END>
any in italy, and as soon moved to be moody, and as <END>
soon moody to be moved. <END>
and what to? <END>
nay, an there were two such, we should have none <END>
shortly, for one would kill the other. thou! why, <END>
thou wilt quarrel with a man that hath a hair more, <END>
or a hair less, in his beard, than thou hast: thou <END>
wilt quarrel with a man for cracking nuts, having no <END>
other reason but because thou hast hazel eyes: what <END>
eye but such an eye would spy out such a quarrel? <END>
thy head is as fun of quarrels as an egg is full of <END>
meat, and yet thy head hath been beaten as addle as <END>
an egg for quarrelling: thou hast quarrelled with a <END>
man for coughing in the street, because he hath <END>
wakened thy dog that hath lain asleep in the sun: <END>
didst thou not fall out with a tailor for wearing <END>
his new doublet before easter? with another, for <END>
tying his new shoes with old riband? and yet thou <END>
wilt tutor me from quarrelling! <END>
an i were so apt to quarrel as thou art, any man <END>
should buy the fee-simple of my life for an hour and a quarter. <END>
the fee-simple! o simple! <END>
by my head, here come the capulets. <END>
by my heel, i care not. <END>
follow me close, for i will speak to them. <END>
gentlemen, good den: a word with one of you. <END>
and but one word with one of us? couple it with <END>
something; make it a word and a blow. <END>
you shall find me apt enough to that, sir, an you <END>
will give me occasion. <END>
could you not take some occasion without giving? <END>
mercutio, thou consort'st with romeo,-- <END>
consort! what, dost thou make us minstrels? an <END>
thou make minstrels of us, look to hear nothing but <END>
discords: here's my fiddlestick; here's that shall <END>
make you dance. 'zounds, consort! <END>
we talk here in the public haunt of men: <END>
either withdraw unto some private place, <END>
and reason coldly of your grievances, <END>
or else depart; here all eyes gaze on us. <END>
men's eyes were made to look, and let them gaze; <END>
i will not budge for no man's pleasure, i. <END>
well, peace be with you, sir: here comes my man. <END>
but i'll be hanged, sir, if he wear your livery: <END>
marry, go before to field, he'll be your follower; <END>
your worship in that sense may call him 'man.' <END>
romeo, the hate i bear thee can afford <END>
no better term than this,--thou art a villain. <END>
tybalt, the reason that i have to love thee <END>
doth much excuse the appertaining rage <END>
to such a greeting: villain am i none; <END>
therefore farewell; i see thou know'st me not. <END>
boy, this shall not excuse the injuries <END>
that thou hast done me; therefore turn and draw. <END>
i do protest, i never injured thee, <END>
but love thee better than thou canst devise, <END>
till thou shalt know the reason of my love: <END>
and so, good capulet,--which name i tender <END>
as dearly as my own,--be satisfied. <END>
o calm, dishonourable, vile submission! <END>
alla stoccata carries it away. <END>
tybalt, you rat-catcher, will you walk? <END>
what wouldst thou have with me? <END>
good king of cats, nothing but one of your nine <END>
lives; that i mean to make bold withal, and as you <END>
shall use me hereafter, drybeat the rest of the <END>
eight. will you pluck your sword out of his pitcher <END>
by the ears? make haste, lest mine be about your <END>
ears ere it be out. <END>
i am for you. <END>
gentle mercutio, put thy rapier up. <END>
come, sir, your passado. <END>
draw, benvolio; beat down their weapons. <END>
gentlemen, for shame, forbear this outrage! <END>
tybalt, mercutio, the prince expressly hath <END>
forbidden bandying in verona streets: <END>
hold, tybalt! good mercutio! <END>
i am hurt. <END>
a plague o' both your houses! i am sped. <END>
is he gone, and hath nothing? <END>
what, art thou hurt? <END>
ay, ay, a scratch, a scratch; marry, 'tis enough. <END>
where is my page? go, villain, fetch a surgeon. <END>
courage, man; the hurt cannot be much. <END>
no, 'tis not so deep as a well, nor so wide as a <END>
church-door; but 'tis enough,'twill serve: ask for <END>
me to-morrow, and you shall find me a grave man. i <END>
am peppered, i warrant, for this world. a plague o' <END>
both your houses! 'zounds, a dog, a rat, a mouse, a <END>
cat, to scratch a man to death! a braggart, a <END>
rogue, a villain, that fights by the book of <END>
arithmetic! why the devil came you between us? i <END>
was hurt under your arm. <END>
i thought all for the best. <END>
help me into some house, benvolio, <END>
or i shall faint. a plague o' both your houses! <END>
they have made worms' meat of me: i have it, <END>
and soundly too: your houses! <END>
this gentleman, the prince's near ally, <END>
my very friend, hath got his mortal hurt <END>
in my behalf; my reputation stain'd <END>
with tybalt's slander,--tybalt, that an hour <END>
hath been my kinsman! o sweet juliet, <END>
thy beauty hath made me effeminate <END>
and in my temper soften'd valour's steel! <END>
o romeo, romeo, brave mercutio's dead! <END>
that gallant spirit hath aspired the clouds, <END>
which too untimely here did scorn the earth. <END>
this day's black fate on more days doth depend; <END>
this but begins the woe, others must end. <END>
here comes the furious tybalt back again. <END>
alive, in triumph! and mercutio slain! <END>
away to heaven, respective lenity, <END>
and fire-eyed fury be my conduct now! <END>
now, tybalt, take the villain back again, <END>
that late thou gavest me; for mercutio's soul <END>
is but a little way above our heads, <END>
staying for thine to keep him company: <END>
either thou, or i, or both, must go with him. <END>
thou, wretched boy, that didst consort him here, <END>
shalt with him hence. <END>
this shall determine that. <END>
romeo, away, be gone! <END>
the citizens are up, and tybalt slain. <END>
stand not amazed: the prince will doom thee death, <END>
if thou art taken: hence, be gone, away! <END>
o, i am fortune's fool! <END>
why dost thou stay? <END>
which way ran he that kill'd mercutio? <END>
tybalt, that murderer, which way ran he? <END>
there lies that tybalt. <END>
up, sir, go with me; <END>
i charge thee in the princes name, obey. <END>
where are the vile beginners of this fray? <END>
o noble prince, i can discover all <END>
the unlucky manage of this fatal brawl: <END>
there lies the man, slain by young romeo, <END>
that slew thy kinsman, brave mercutio. <END>
tybalt, my cousin! o my brother's child! <END>
o prince! o cousin! husband! o, the blood is spilt <END>
o my dear kinsman! prince, as thou art true, <END>
for blood of ours, shed blood of montague. <END>
o cousin, cousin! <END>
benvolio, who began this bloody fray? <END>
tybalt, here slain, whom romeo's hand did slay; <END>
romeo that spoke him fair, bade him bethink <END>
how nice the quarrel was, and urged withal <END>
your high displeasure: all this uttered <END>
with gentle breath, calm look, knees humbly bow'd, <END>
could not take truce with the unruly spleen <END>
of tybalt deaf to peace, but that he tilts <END>
with piercing steel at bold mercutio's breast, <END>
who all as hot, turns deadly point to point, <END>
and, with a martial scorn, with one hand beats <END>
cold death aside, and with the other sends <END>
it back to tybalt, whose dexterity, <END>
retorts it: romeo he cries aloud, <END>
'hold, friends! friends, part!' and, swifter than <END>
his tongue, <END>
his agile arm beats down their fatal points, <END>
and 'twixt them rushes; underneath whose arm <END>
an envious thrust from tybalt hit the life <END>
of stout mercutio, and then tybalt fled; <END>
but by and by comes back to romeo, <END>
who had but newly entertain'd revenge, <END>
and to 't they go like lightning, for, ere i <END>
could draw to part them, was stout tybalt slain. <END>
and, as he fell, did romeo turn and fly. <END>
this is the truth, or let benvolio die. <END>
he is a kinsman to the montague; <END>
affection makes him false; he speaks not true: <END>
some twenty of them fought in this black strife, <END>
and all those twenty could but kill one life. <END>
i beg for justice, which thou, prince, must give; <END>
romeo slew tybalt, romeo must not live. <END>
romeo slew him, he slew mercutio; <END>
who now the price of his dear blood doth owe? <END>
not romeo, prince, he was mercutio's friend; <END>
his fault concludes but what the law should end, <END>
the life of tybalt. <END>
and for that offence <END>
immediately we do exile him hence: <END>
i have an interest in your hate's proceeding, <END>
my blood for your rude brawls doth lie a-bleeding; <END>
but i'll amerce you with so strong a fine <END>
that you shall all repent the loss of mine: <END>
i will be deaf to pleading and excuses; <END>
nor tears nor prayers shall purchase out abuses: <END>
therefore use none: let romeo hence in haste, <END>
else, when he's found, that hour is his last. <END>
bear hence this body and attend our will: <END>
mercy but murders, pardoning those that kill. <END>
gallop apace, you fiery-footed steeds, <END>
towards phoebus' lodging: such a wagoner <END>
as phaethon would whip you to the west, <END>
and bring in cloudy night immediately. <END>
spread thy close curtain, love-performing night, <END>
that runaway's eyes may wink and romeo <END>
leap to these arms, untalk'd of and unseen. <END>
lovers can see to do their amorous rites <END>
by their own beauties; or, if love be blind, <END>
it best agrees with night. come, civil night, <END>
thou sober-suited matron, all in black, <END>
and learn me how to lose a winning match, <END>
play'd for a pair of stainless maidenhoods: <END>
hood my unmann'd blood, bating in my cheeks, <END>
with thy black mantle; till strange love, grown bold, <END>
think true love acted simple modesty. <END>
come, night; come, romeo; come, thou day in night; <END>
for thou wilt lie upon the wings of night <END>
whiter than new snow on a raven's back. <END>
come, gentle night, come, loving, black-brow'd night, <END>
give me my romeo; and, when he shall die, <END>
take him and cut him out in little stars, <END>
and he will make the face of heaven so fine <END>
that all the world will be in love with night <END>
and pay no worship to the garish sun. <END>
o, i have bought the mansion of a love, <END>
but not possess'd it, and, though i am sold, <END>
not yet enjoy'd: so tedious is this day <END>
as is the night before some festival <END>
to an impatient child that hath new robes <END>
and may not wear them. o, here comes my nurse, <END>
and she brings news; and every tongue that speaks <END>
but romeo's name speaks heavenly eloquence. <END>
now, nurse, what news? what hast thou there? the cords <END>
that romeo bid thee fetch? <END>
ay, ay, the cords. <END>
ay me! what news? why dost thou wring thy hands? <END>
ah, well-a-day! he's dead, he's dead, he's dead! <END>
we are undone, lady, we are undone! <END>
alack the day! he's gone, he's kill'd, he's dead! <END>
can heaven be so envious? <END>
romeo can, <END>
though heaven cannot: o romeo, romeo! <END>
who ever would have thought it? romeo! <END>
what devil art thou, that dost torment me thus? <END>
this torture should be roar'd in dismal hell. <END>
hath romeo slain himself? say thou but 'i,' <END>
and that bare vowel 'i' shall poison more <END>
than the death-darting eye of cockatrice: <END>
i am not i, if there be such an i; <END>
or those eyes shut, that make thee answer 'i.' <END>
if he be slain, say 'i'; or if not, no: <END>
brief sounds determine of my weal or woe. <END>
i saw the wound, i saw it with mine eyes,-- <END>
god save the mark!--here on his manly breast: <END>
a piteous corse, a bloody piteous corse; <END>
pale, pale as ashes, all bedaub'd in blood, <END>
all in gore-blood; i swounded at the sight. <END>
o, break, my heart! poor bankrupt, break at once! <END>
to prison, eyes, ne'er look on liberty! <END>
vile earth, to earth resign; end motion here; <END>
and thou and romeo press one heavy bier! <END>
o tybalt, tybalt, the best friend i had! <END>
o courteous tybalt! honest gentleman! <END>
that ever i should live to see thee dead! <END>
what storm is this that blows so contrary? <END>
is romeo slaughter'd, and is tybalt dead? <END>
my dear-loved cousin, and my dearer lord? <END>
then, dreadful trumpet, sound the general doom! <END>
for who is living, if those two are gone? <END>
tybalt is gone, and romeo banished; <END>
romeo that kill'd him, he is banished. <END>
o god! did romeo's hand shed tybalt's blood? <END>
it did, it did; alas the day, it did! <END>
o serpent heart, hid with a flowering face! <END>
did ever dragon keep so fair a cave? <END>
beautiful tyrant! fiend angelical! <END>
dove-feather'd raven! wolvish-ravening lamb! <END>
despised substance of divinest show! <END>
just opposite to what thou justly seem'st, <END>
a damned saint, an honourable villain! <END>
o nature, what hadst thou to do in hell, <END>
when thou didst bower the spirit of a fiend <END>
in moral paradise of such sweet flesh? <END>
was ever book containing such vile matter <END>
so fairly bound? o that deceit should dwell <END>
in such a gorgeous palace! <END>
there's no trust, <END>
no faith, no honesty in men; all perjured, <END>
all forsworn, all naught, all dissemblers. <END>
ah, where's my man? give me some aqua vitae: <END>
these griefs, these woes, these sorrows make me old. <END>
shame come to romeo! <END>
blister'd be thy tongue <END>
for such a wish! he was not born to shame: <END>
upon his brow shame is ashamed to sit; <END>
for 'tis a throne where honour may be crown'd <END>
sole monarch of the universal earth. <END>
o, what a beast was i to chide at him! <END>
will you speak well of him that kill'd your cousin? <END>
shall i speak ill of him that is my husband? <END>
ah, poor my lord, what tongue shall smooth thy name, <END>
when i, thy three-hours wife, have mangled it? <END>
but, wherefore, villain, didst thou kill my cousin? <END>
that villain cousin would have kill'd my husband: <END>
back, foolish tears, back to your native spring; <END>
your tributary drops belong to woe, <END>
which you, mistaking, offer up to joy. <END>
my husband lives, that tybalt would have slain; <END>
and tybalt's dead, that would have slain my husband: <END>
all this is comfort; wherefore weep i then? <END>
some word there was, worser than tybalt's death, <END>
that murder'd me: i would forget it fain; <END>
but, o, it presses to my memory, <END>
like damned guilty deeds to sinners' minds: <END>
'tybalt is dead, and romeo--banished;' <END>
that 'banished,' that one word 'banished,' <END>
hath slain ten thousand tybalts. tybalt's death <END>
was woe enough, if it had ended there: <END>
or, if sour woe delights in fellowship <END>
and needly will be rank'd with other griefs, <END>
why follow'd not, when she said 'tybalt's dead,' <END>
thy father, or thy mother, nay, or both, <END>
which modern lamentations might have moved? <END>
but with a rear-ward following tybalt's death, <END>
'romeo is banished,' to speak that word, <END>
is father, mother, tybalt, romeo, juliet, <END>
all slain, all dead. 'romeo is banished!' <END>
there is no end, no limit, measure, bound, <END>
in that word's death; no words can that woe sound. <END>
where is my father, and my mother, nurse? <END>
weeping and wailing over tybalt's corse: <END>
will you go to them? i will bring you thither. <END>
wash they his wounds with tears: mine shall be spent, <END>
when theirs are dry, for romeo's banishment. <END>
take up those cords: poor ropes, you are beguiled, <END>
both you and i; for romeo is exiled: <END>
he made you for a highway to my bed; <END>
but i, a maid, die maiden-widowed. <END>
come, cords, come, nurse; i'll to my wedding-bed; <END>
and death, not romeo, take my maidenhead! <END>
hie to your chamber: i'll find romeo <END>
to comfort you: i wot well where he is. <END>
hark ye, your romeo will be here at night: <END>
i'll to him; he is hid at laurence' cell. <END>
o, find him! give this ring to my true knight, <END>
and bid him come to take his last farewell. <END>
romeo, come forth; come forth, thou fearful man: <END>
affliction is enamour'd of thy parts, <END>
and thou art wedded to calamity. <END>
father, what news? what is the prince's doom? <END>
what sorrow craves acquaintance at my hand, <END>
that i yet know not? <END>
too familiar <END>
is my dear son with such sour company: <END>
i bring thee tidings of the prince's doom. <END>
what less than dooms-day is the prince's doom? <END>
a gentler judgment vanish'd from his lips, <END>
not body's death, but body's banishment. <END>
ha, banishment! be merciful, say 'death;' <END>
for exile hath more terror in his look, <END>
much more than death: do not say 'banishment.' <END>
hence from verona art thou banished: <END>
be patient, for the world is broad and wide. <END>
there is no world without verona walls, <END>
but purgatory, torture, hell itself. <END>
hence-banished is banish'd from the world, <END>
and world's exile is death: then banished, <END>
is death mis-term'd: calling death banishment, <END>
thou cutt'st my head off with a golden axe, <END>
and smilest upon the stroke that murders me. <END>
o deadly sin! o rude unthankfulness! <END>
thy fault our law calls death; but the kind prince, <END>
taking thy part, hath rush'd aside the law, <END>
and turn'd that black word death to banishment: <END>
this is dear mercy, and thou seest it not. <END>
'tis torture, and not mercy: heaven is here, <END>
where juliet lives; and every cat and dog <END>
and little mouse, every unworthy thing, <END>
live here in heaven and may look on her; <END>
but romeo may not: more validity, <END>
more honourable state, more courtship lives <END>
in carrion-flies than romeo: they my seize <END>
on the white wonder of dear juliet's hand <END>
and steal immortal blessing from her lips, <END>
who even in pure and vestal modesty, <END>
still blush, as thinking their own kisses sin; <END>
but romeo may not; he is banished: <END>
flies may do this, but i from this must fly: <END>
they are free men, but i am banished. <END>
and say'st thou yet that exile is not death? <END>
hadst thou no poison mix'd, no sharp-ground knife, <END>
no sudden mean of death, though ne'er so mean, <END>
but 'banished' to kill me?--'banished'? <END>
o friar, the damned use that word in hell; <END>
howlings attend it: how hast thou the heart, <END>
being a divine, a ghostly confessor, <END>
a sin-absolver, and my friend profess'd, <END>
to mangle me with that word 'banished'? <END>
thou fond mad man, hear me but speak a word. <END>
o, thou wilt speak again of banishment. <END>
i'll give thee armour to keep off that word: <END>
adversity's sweet milk, philosophy, <END>
to comfort thee, though thou art banished. <END>
yet 'banished'? hang up philosophy! <END>
unless philosophy can make a juliet, <END>
displant a town, reverse a prince's doom, <END>
it helps not, it prevails not: talk no more. <END>
o, then i see that madmen have no ears. <END>
how should they, when that wise men have no eyes? <END>
let me dispute with thee of thy estate. <END>
thou canst not speak of that thou dost not feel: <END>
wert thou as young as i, juliet thy love, <END>
an hour but married, tybalt murdered, <END>
doting like me and like me banished, <END>
then mightst thou speak, then mightst thou tear thy hair, <END>
and fall upon the ground, as i do now, <END>
taking the measure of an unmade grave. <END>
arise; one knocks; good romeo, hide thyself. <END>
not i; unless the breath of heartsick groans, <END>
mist-like, infold me from the search of eyes. <END>
hark, how they knock! who's there? romeo, arise; <END>
thou wilt be taken. stay awhile! stand up; <END>
run to my study. by and by! god's will, <END>
what simpleness is this! i come, i come! <END>
who knocks so hard? whence come you? what's your will? <END>
welcome, then. <END>
o holy friar, o, tell me, holy friar, <END>
where is my lady's lord, where's romeo? <END>
there on the ground, with his own tears made drunk. <END>
o, he is even in my mistress' case, <END>
just in her case! o woful sympathy! <END>
piteous predicament! even so lies she, <END>
blubbering and weeping, weeping and blubbering. <END>
stand up, stand up; stand, and you be a man: <END>
for juliet's sake, for her sake, rise and stand; <END>
why should you fall into so deep an o? <END>
nurse! <END>
ah sir! ah sir! well, death's the end of all. <END>
spakest thou of juliet? how is it with her? <END>
doth she not think me an old murderer, <END>
now i have stain'd the childhood of our joy <END>
with blood removed but little from her own? <END>
where is she? and how doth she? and what says <END>
my conceal'd lady to our cancell'd love? <END>
o, she says nothing, sir, but weeps and weeps; <END>
and now falls on her bed; and then starts up, <END>
and tybalt calls; and then on romeo cries, <END>
and then down falls again. <END>
as if that name, <END>
shot from the deadly level of a gun, <END>
did murder her; as that name's cursed hand <END>
murder'd her kinsman. o, tell me, friar, tell me, <END>
in what vile part of this anatomy <END>
doth my name lodge? tell me, that i may sack <END>
the hateful mansion. <END>
hold thy desperate hand: <END>
art thou a man? thy form cries out thou art: <END>
thy tears are womanish; thy wild acts denote <END>
the unreasonable fury of a beast: <END>
unseemly woman in a seeming man! <END>
or ill-beseeming beast in seeming both! <END>
thou hast amazed me: by my holy order, <END>
i thought thy disposition better temper'd. <END>
hast thou slain tybalt? wilt thou slay thyself? <END>
and stay thy lady too that lives in thee, <END>
by doing damned hate upon thyself? <END>
why rail'st thou on thy birth, the heaven, and earth? <END>
since birth, and heaven, and earth, all three do meet <END>
in thee at once; which thou at once wouldst lose. <END>
fie, fie, thou shamest thy shape, thy love, thy wit; <END>
which, like a usurer, abound'st in all, <END>
and usest none in that true use indeed <END>
which should bedeck thy shape, thy love, thy wit: <END>
thy noble shape is but a form of wax, <END>
digressing from the valour of a man; <END>
thy dear love sworn but hollow perjury, <END>
killing that love which thou hast vow'd to cherish; <END>
thy wit, that ornament to shape and love, <END>
misshapen in the conduct of them both, <END>
like powder in a skitless soldier's flask, <END>
is set afire by thine own ignorance, <END>
and thou dismember'd with thine own defence. <END>
what, rouse thee, man! thy juliet is alive, <END>
for whose dear sake thou wast but lately dead; <END>
there art thou happy: tybalt would kill thee, <END>
but thou slew'st tybalt; there are thou happy too: <END>
the law that threaten'd death becomes thy friend <END>
and turns it to exile; there art thou happy: <END>
a pack of blessings lights up upon thy back; <END>
happiness courts thee in her best array; <END>
but, like a misbehaved and sullen wench, <END>
thou pout'st upon thy fortune and thy love: <END>
take heed, take heed, for such die miserable. <END>
go, get thee to thy love, as was decreed, <END>
ascend her chamber, hence and comfort her: <END>
but look thou stay not till the watch be set, <END>
for then thou canst not pass to mantua; <END>
where thou shalt live, till we can find a time <END>
to blaze your marriage, reconcile your friends, <END>
beg pardon of the prince, and call thee back <END>
with twenty hundred thousand times more joy <END>
than thou went'st forth in lamentation. <END>
go before, nurse: commend me to thy lady; <END>
and bid her hasten all the house to bed, <END>
which heavy sorrow makes them apt unto: <END>
romeo is coming. <END>
o lord, i could have stay'd here all the night <END>
to hear good counsel: o, what learning is! <END>
my lord, i'll tell my lady you will come. <END>
do so, and bid my sweet prepare to chide. <END>
here, sir, a ring she bid me give you, sir: <END>
hie you, make haste, for it grows very late. <END>
how well my comfort is revived by this! <END>
go hence; good night; and here stands all your state: <END>
either be gone before the watch be set, <END>
or by the break of day disguised from hence: <END>
sojourn in mantua; i'll find out your man, <END>
and he shall signify from time to time <END>
every good hap to you that chances here: <END>
give me thy hand; 'tis late: farewell; good night. <END>
but that a joy past joy calls out on me, <END>
it were a grief, so brief to part with thee: farewell. <END>
things have fall'n out, sir, so unluckily, <END>
that we have had no time to move our daughter: <END>
look you, she loved her kinsman tybalt dearly, <END>
and so did i:--well, we were born to die. <END>
'tis very late, she'll not come down to-night: <END>
i promise you, but for your company, <END>
i would have been a-bed an hour ago. <END>
these times of woe afford no time to woo. <END>
madam, good night: commend me to your daughter. <END>
i will, and know her mind early to-morrow; <END>
to-night she is mew'd up to her heaviness. <END>
sir paris, i will make a desperate tender <END>
of my child's love: i think she will be ruled <END>
in all respects by me; nay, more, i doubt it not. <END>
wife, go you to her ere you go to bed; <END>
acquaint her here of my son paris' love; <END>
and bid her, mark you me, on wednesday next-- <END>
but, soft! what day is this? <END>
monday, my lord, <END>
monday! ha, ha! well, wednesday is too soon, <END>
o' thursday let it be: o' thursday, tell her, <END>
she shall be married to this noble earl. <END>
will you be ready? do you like this haste? <END>
we'll keep no great ado,--a friend or two; <END>
for, hark you, tybalt being slain so late, <END>
it may be thought we held him carelessly, <END>
being our kinsman, if we revel much: <END>
therefore we'll have some half a dozen friends, <END>
and there an end. but what say you to thursday? <END>
my lord, i would that thursday were to-morrow. <END>
well get you gone: o' thursday be it, then. <END>
go you to juliet ere you go to bed, <END>
prepare her, wife, against this wedding-day. <END>
farewell, my lord. light to my chamber, ho! <END>
afore me! it is so very very late, <END>
that we may call it early by and by. <END>
good night. <END>
wilt thou be gone? it is not yet near day: <END>
it was the nightingale, and not the lark, <END>
that pierced the fearful hollow of thine ear; <END>
nightly she sings on yon pomegranate-tree: <END>
believe me, love, it was the nightingale. <END>
it was the lark, the herald of the morn, <END>
no nightingale: look, love, what envious streaks <END>
do lace the severing clouds in yonder east: <END>
night's candles are burnt out, and jocund day <END>
stands tiptoe on the misty mountain tops. <END>
i must be gone and live, or stay and die. <END>
yon light is not day-light, i know it, i: <END>
it is some meteor that the sun exhales, <END>
to be to thee this night a torch-bearer, <END>
and light thee on thy way to mantua: <END>
therefore stay yet; thou need'st not to be gone. <END>
let me be ta'en, let me be put to death; <END>
i am content, so thou wilt have it so. <END>
i'll say yon grey is not the morning's eye, <END>
'tis but the pale reflex of cynthia's brow; <END>
nor that is not the lark, whose notes do beat <END>
the vaulty heaven so high above our heads: <END>
i have more care to stay than will to go: <END>
come, death, and welcome! juliet wills it so. <END>
how is't, my soul? let's talk; it is not day. <END>
it is, it is: hie hence, be gone, away! <END>
it is the lark that sings so out of tune, <END>
straining harsh discords and unpleasing sharps. <END>
some say the lark makes sweet division; <END>
this doth not so, for she divideth us: <END>
some say the lark and loathed toad change eyes, <END>
o, now i would they had changed voices too! <END>
since arm from arm that voice doth us affray, <END>
hunting thee hence with hunt's-up to the day, <END>
o, now be gone; more light and light it grows. <END>
more light and light; more dark and dark our woes! <END>
madam! <END>
nurse? <END>
your lady mother is coming to your chamber: <END>
the day is broke; be wary, look about. <END>
then, window, let day in, and let life out. <END>
farewell, farewell! one kiss, and i'll descend. <END>
art thou gone so? love, lord, ay, husband, friend! <END>
i must hear from thee every day in the hour, <END>
for in a minute there are many days: <END>
o, by this count i shall be much in years <END>
ere i again behold my romeo! <END>
farewell! <END>
i will omit no opportunity <END>
that may convey my greetings, love, to thee. <END>
o think'st thou we shall ever meet again? <END>
i doubt it not; and all these woes shall serve <END>
for sweet discourses in our time to come. <END>
o god, i have an ill-divining soul! <END>
methinks i see thee, now thou art below, <END>
as one dead in the bottom of a tomb: <END>
either my eyesight fails, or thou look'st pale. <END>
and trust me, love, in my eye so do you: <END>
dry sorrow drinks our blood. adieu, adieu! <END>
o fortune, fortune! all men call thee fickle: <END>
if thou art fickle, what dost thou with him. <END>
that is renown'd for faith? be fickle, fortune; <END>
for then, i hope, thou wilt not keep him long, <END>
but send him back. <END>
who is't that calls? is it my lady mother? <END>
is she not down so late, or up so early? <END>
what unaccustom'd cause procures her hither? <END>
why, how now, juliet! <END>
madam, i am not well. <END>
evermore weeping for your cousin's death? <END>
what, wilt thou wash him from his grave with tears? <END>
an if thou couldst, thou couldst not make him live; <END>
therefore, have done: some grief shows much of love; <END>
but much of grief shows still some want of wit. <END>
yet let me weep for such a feeling loss. <END>
so shall you feel the loss, but not the friend <END>
which you weep for. <END>
feeling so the loss, <END>
cannot choose but ever weep the friend. <END>
well, girl, thou weep'st not so much for his death, <END>
as that the villain lives which slaughter'd him. <END>
what villain madam? <END>
that same villain, romeo. <END>
that is, because the traitor murderer lives. <END>
ay, madam, from the reach of these my hands: <END>
would none but i might venge my cousin's death! <END>
we will have vengeance for it, fear thou not: <END>
then weep no more. i'll send to one in mantua, <END>
where that same banish'd runagate doth live, <END>
shall give him such an unaccustom'd dram, <END>
that he shall soon keep tybalt company: <END>
and then, i hope, thou wilt be satisfied. <END>
indeed, i never shall be satisfied <END>
with romeo, till i behold him--dead-- <END>
is my poor heart for a kinsman vex'd. <END>
madam, if you could find out but a man <END>
to bear a poison, i would temper it; <END>
that romeo should, upon receipt thereof, <END>
soon sleep in quiet. o, how my heart abhors <END>
to hear him named, and cannot come to him. <END>
to wreak the love i bore my cousin <END>
upon his body that slaughter'd him! <END>
find thou the means, and i'll find such a man. <END>
but now i'll tell thee joyful tidings, girl. <END>
and joy comes well in such a needy time: <END>
what are they, i beseech your ladyship? <END>
well, well, thou hast a careful father, child; <END>
one who, to put thee from thy heaviness, <END>
hath sorted out a sudden day of joy, <END>
that thou expect'st not nor i look'd not for. <END>
madam, in happy time, what day is that? <END>
marry, my child, early next thursday morn, <END>
the gallant, young and noble gentleman, <END>
the county paris, at saint peter's church, <END>
shall happily make thee there a joyful bride. <END>
now, by saint peter's church and peter too, <END>
he shall not make me there a joyful bride. <END>
i wonder at this haste; that i must wed <END>
ere he, that should be husband, comes to woo. <END>
i pray you, tell my lord and father, madam, <END>
i will not marry yet; and, when i do, i swear, <END>
it shall be romeo, whom you know i hate, <END>
rather than paris. these are news indeed! <END>
here comes your father; tell him so yourself, <END>
and see how he will take it at your hands. <END>
when the sun sets, the air doth drizzle dew; <END>
but for the sunset of my brother's son <END>
it rains downright. <END>
how now! a conduit, girl? what, still in tears? <END>
evermore showering? in one little body <END>
thou counterfeit'st a bark, a sea, a wind; <END>
for still thy eyes, which i may call the sea, <END>
do ebb and flow with tears; the bark thy body is, <END>
sailing in this salt flood; the winds, thy sighs; <END>
who, raging with thy tears, and they with them, <END>
without a sudden calm, will overset <END>
thy tempest-tossed body. how now, wife! <END>
have you deliver'd to her our decree? <END>
ay, sir; but she will none, she gives you thanks. <END>
i would the fool were married to her grave! <END>
soft! take me with you, take me with you, wife. <END>
how! will she none? doth she not give us thanks? <END>
is she not proud? doth she not count her blest, <END>
unworthy as she is, that we have wrought <END>
so worthy a gentleman to be her bridegroom? <END>
not proud, you have; but thankful, that you have: <END>
proud can i never be of what i hate; <END>
but thankful even for hate, that is meant love. <END>
how now, how now, chop-logic! what is this? <END>
'proud,' and 'i thank you,' and 'i thank you not;' <END>
and yet 'not proud,' mistress minion, you, <END>
thank me no thankings, nor, proud me no prouds, <END>
but fettle your fine joints 'gainst thursday next, <END>
to go with paris to saint peter's church, <END>
or i will drag thee on a hurdle thither. <END>
out, you green-sickness carrion! out, you baggage! <END>
you tallow-face! <END>
fie, fie! what, are you mad? <END>
good father, i beseech you on my knees, <END>
hear me with patience but to speak a word. <END>
hang thee, young baggage! disobedient wretch! <END>
i tell thee what: get thee to church o' thursday, <END>
or never after look me in the face: <END>
speak not, reply not, do not answer me; <END>
my fingers itch. wife, we scarce thought us blest <END>
that god had lent us but this only child; <END>
but now i see this one is one too much, <END>
and that we have a curse in having her: <END>
out on her, hilding! <END>
god in heaven bless her! <END>
you are to blame, my lord, to rate her so. <END>
and why, my lady wisdom? hold your tongue, <END>
good prudence; smatter with your gossips, go. <END>
i speak no treason. <END>
o, god ye god-den. <END>
may not one speak? <END>
peace, you mumbling fool! <END>
utter your gravity o'er a gossip's bowl; <END>
for here we need it not. <END>
you are too hot. <END>
god's bread! it makes me mad: <END>
day, night, hour, tide, time, work, play, <END>
alone, in company, still my care hath been <END>
to have her match'd: and having now provided <END>
a gentleman of noble parentage, <END>
of fair demesnes, youthful, and nobly train'd, <END>
stuff'd, as they say, with honourable parts, <END>
proportion'd as one's thought would wish a man; <END>
and then to have a wretched puling fool, <END>
a whining mammet, in her fortune's tender, <END>
to answer 'i'll not wed; i cannot love, <END>
i am too young; i pray you, pardon me.' <END>
but, as you will not wed, i'll pardon you: <END>
graze where you will you shall not house with me: <END>
look to't, think on't, i do not use to jest. <END>
thursday is near; lay hand on heart, advise: <END>
an you be mine, i'll give you to my friend; <END>
and you be not, hang, beg, starve, die in <END>
the streets, <END>
for, by my soul, i'll ne'er acknowledge thee, <END>
nor what is mine shall never do thee good: <END>
trust to't, bethink you; i'll not be forsworn. <END>
is there no pity sitting in the clouds, <END>
that sees into the bottom of my grief? <END>
o, sweet my mother, cast me not away! <END>
delay this marriage for a month, a week; <END>
or, if you do not, make the bridal bed <END>
in that dim monument where tybalt lies. <END>
talk not to me, for i'll not speak a word: <END>
do as thou wilt, for i have done with thee. <END>
o god!--o nurse, how shall this be prevented? <END>
my husband is on earth, my faith in heaven; <END>
how shall that faith return again to earth, <END>
unless that husband send it me from heaven <END>
by leaving earth? comfort me, counsel me. <END>
alack, alack, that heaven should practise stratagems <END>
upon so soft a subject as myself! <END>
what say'st thou? hast thou not a word of joy? <END>
some comfort, nurse. <END>
faith, here it is. <END>
romeo is banish'd; and all the world to nothing, <END>
that he dares ne'er come back to challenge you; <END>
or, if he do, it needs must be by stealth. <END>
then, since the case so stands as now it doth, <END>
i think it best you married with the county. <END>
o, he's a lovely gentleman! <END>
romeo's a dishclout to him: an eagle, madam, <END>
hath not so green, so quick, so fair an eye <END>
as paris hath. beshrew my very heart, <END>
i think you are happy in this second match, <END>
for it excels your first: or if it did not, <END>
your first is dead; or 'twere as good he were, <END>
as living here and you no use of him. <END>
speakest thou from thy heart? <END>
and from my soul too; <END>
or else beshrew them both. <END>
amen! <END>
what? <END>
well, thou hast comforted me marvellous much. <END>
go in: and tell my lady i am gone, <END>
having displeased my father, to laurence' cell, <END>
to make confession and to be absolved. <END>
marry, i will; and this is wisely done. <END>
ancient damnation! o most wicked fiend! <END>
is it more sin to wish me thus forsworn, <END>
or to dispraise my lord with that same tongue <END>
which she hath praised him with above compare <END>
so many thousand times? go, counsellor; <END>
thou and my bosom henceforth shall be twain. <END>
i'll to the friar, to know his remedy: <END>
if all else fail, myself have power to die. <END>
on thursday, sir? the time is very short. <END>
my father capulet will have it so; <END>
and i am nothing slow to slack his haste. <END>
you say you do not know the lady's mind: <END>
uneven is the course, i like it not. <END>
immoderately she weeps for tybalt's death, <END>
and therefore have i little talk'd of love; <END>
for venus smiles not in a house of tears. <END>
now, sir, her father counts it dangerous <END>
that she doth give her sorrow so much sway, <END>
and in his wisdom hastes our marriage, <END>
to stop the inundation of her tears; <END>
which, too much minded by herself alone, <END>
may be put from her by society: <END>
now do you know the reason of this haste. <END>
happily met, my lady and my wife! <END>
that may be, sir, when i may be a wife. <END>
that may be must be, love, on thursday next. <END>
what must be shall be. <END>
that's a certain text. <END>
come you to make confession to this father? <END>
to answer that, i should confess to you. <END>
do not deny to him that you love me. <END>
i will confess to you that i love him. <END>
so will ye, i am sure, that you love me. <END>
if i do so, it will be of more price, <END>
being spoke behind your back, than to your face. <END>
poor soul, thy face is much abused with tears. <END>
the tears have got small victory by that; <END>
for it was bad enough before their spite. <END>
thou wrong'st it, more than tears, with that report. <END>
that is no slander, sir, which is a truth; <END>
and what i spake, i spake it to my face. <END>
thy face is mine, and thou hast slander'd it. <END>
it may be so, for it is not mine own. <END>
are you at leisure, holy father, now; <END>
or shall i come to you at evening mass? <END>
my leisure serves me, pensive daughter, now. <END>
my lord, we must entreat the time alone. <END>
god shield i should disturb devotion! <END>
juliet, on thursday early will i rouse ye: <END>
till then, adieu; and keep this holy kiss. <END>
o shut the door! and when thou hast done so, <END>
come weep with me; past hope, past cure, past help! <END>
ah, juliet, i already know thy grief; <END>
it strains me past the compass of my wits: <END>
i hear thou must, and nothing may prorogue it, <END>
on thursday next be married to this county. <END>
tell me not, friar, that thou hear'st of this, <END>
unless thou tell me how i may prevent it: <END>
if, in thy wisdom, thou canst give no help, <END>
do thou but call my resolution wise, <END>
and with this knife i'll help it presently. <END>
god join'd my heart and romeo's, thou our hands; <END>
and ere this hand, by thee to romeo seal'd, <END>
shall be the label to another deed, <END>
or my true heart with treacherous revolt <END>
turn to another, this shall slay them both: <END>
therefore, out of thy long-experienced time, <END>
give me some present counsel, or, behold, <END>
'twixt my extremes and me this bloody knife <END>
shall play the umpire, arbitrating that <END>
which the commission of thy years and art <END>
could to no issue of true honour bring. <END>
be not so long to speak; i long to die, <END>
if what thou speak'st speak not of remedy. <END>
hold, daughter: i do spy a kind of hope, <END>
which craves as desperate an execution. <END>
as that is desperate which we would prevent. <END>
if, rather than to marry county paris, <END>
thou hast the strength of will to slay thyself, <END>
then is it likely thou wilt undertake <END>
a thing like death to chide away this shame, <END>
that copest with death himself to scape from it: <END>
and, if thou darest, i'll give thee remedy. <END>
o, bid me leap, rather than marry paris, <END>
from off the battlements of yonder tower; <END>
or walk in thievish ways; or bid me lurk <END>
where serpents are; chain me with roaring bears; <END>
or shut me nightly in a charnel-house, <END>
o'er-cover'd quite with dead men's rattling bones, <END>
with reeky shanks and yellow chapless skulls; <END>
or bid me go into a new-made grave <END>
and hide me with a dead man in his shroud; <END>
things that, to hear them told, have made me tremble; <END>
and i will do it without fear or doubt, <END>
to live an unstain'd wife to my sweet love. <END>
hold, then; go home, be merry, give consent <END>
to marry paris: wednesday is to-morrow: <END>
to-morrow night look that thou lie alone; <END>
let not thy nurse lie with thee in thy chamber: <END>
take thou this vial, being then in bed, <END>
and this distilled liquor drink thou off; <END>
when presently through all thy veins shall run <END>
a cold and drowsy humour, for no pulse <END>
shall keep his native progress, but surcease: <END>
no warmth, no breath, shall testify thou livest; <END>
the roses in thy lips and cheeks shall fade <END>
to paly ashes, thy eyes' windows fall, <END>
like death, when he shuts up the day of life; <END>
each part, deprived of supple government, <END>
shall, stiff and stark and cold, appear like death: <END>
and in this borrow'd likeness of shrunk death <END>
thou shalt continue two and forty hours, <END>
and then awake as from a pleasant sleep. <END>
now, when the bridegroom in the morning comes <END>
to rouse thee from thy bed, there art thou dead: <END>
then, as the manner of our country is, <END>
in thy best robes uncover'd on the bier <END>
thou shalt be borne to that same ancient vault <END>
where all the kindred of the capulets lie. <END>
in the mean time, against thou shalt awake, <END>
shall romeo by my letters know our drift, <END>
and hither shall he come: and he and i <END>
will watch thy waking, and that very night <END>
shall romeo bear thee hence to mantua. <END>
and this shall free thee from this present shame; <END>
if no inconstant toy, nor womanish fear, <END>
abate thy valour in the acting it. <END>
give me, give me! o, tell not me of fear! <END>
hold; get you gone, be strong and prosperous <END>
in this resolve: i'll send a friar with speed <END>
to mantua, with my letters to thy lord. <END>
love give me strength! and strength shall help afford. <END>
farewell, dear father! <END>
so many guests invite as here are writ. <END>
sirrah, go hire me twenty cunning cooks. <END>
you shall have none ill, sir; for i'll try if they <END>
can lick their fingers. <END>
how canst thou try them so? <END>
marry, sir, 'tis an ill cook that cannot lick his <END>
own fingers: therefore he that cannot lick his <END>
fingers goes not with me. <END>
go, be gone. <END>
we shall be much unfurnished for this time. <END>
what, is my daughter gone to friar laurence? <END>
ay, forsooth. <END>
well, he may chance to do some good on her: <END>
a peevish self-will'd harlotry it is. <END>
see where she comes from shrift with merry look. <END>
how now, my headstrong! where have you been gadding? <END>
where i have learn'd me to repent the sin <END>
of disobedient opposition <END>
to you and your behests, and am enjoin'd <END>
by holy laurence to fall prostrate here, <END>
and beg your pardon: pardon, i beseech you! <END>
henceforward i am ever ruled by you. <END>
send for the county; go tell him of this: <END>
i'll have this knot knit up to-morrow morning. <END>
i met the youthful lord at laurence' cell; <END>
and gave him what becomed love i might, <END>
not step o'er the bounds of modesty. <END>
why, i am glad on't; this is well: stand up: <END>
this is as't should be. let me see the county; <END>
ay, marry, go, i say, and fetch him hither. <END>
now, afore god! this reverend holy friar, <END>
our whole city is much bound to him. <END>
nurse, will you go with me into my closet, <END>
to help me sort such needful ornaments <END>
as you think fit to furnish me to-morrow? <END>
no, not till thursday; there is time enough. <END>
go, nurse, go with her: we'll to church to-morrow. <END>
lady  capulet: <END>
we shall be short in our provision: <END>
'tis now near night. <END>
tush, i will stir about, <END>
and all things shall be well, i warrant thee, wife: <END>
go thou to juliet, help to deck up her; <END>
i'll not to bed to-night; let me alone; <END>
i'll play the housewife for this once. what, ho! <END>
they are all forth. well, i will walk myself <END>
to county paris, to prepare him up <END>
against to-morrow: my heart is wondrous light, <END>
since this same wayward girl is so reclaim'd. <END>
ay, those attires are best: but, gentle nurse, <END>
i pray thee, leave me to myself to-night, <END>
for i have need of many orisons <END>
to move the heavens to smile upon my state, <END>
which, well thou know'st, is cross, and full of sin. <END>
what, are you busy, ho? need you my help? <END>
no, madam; we have cull'd such necessaries <END>
as are behoveful for our state to-morrow: <END>
so please you, let me now be left alone, <END>
and let the nurse this night sit up with you; <END>
for, i am sure, you have your hands full all, <END>
in this so sudden business. <END>
good night: <END>
get thee to bed, and rest; for thou hast need. <END>
farewell! god knows when we shall meet again. <END>
i have a faint cold fear thrills through my veins, <END>
that almost freezes up the heat of life: <END>
i'll call them back again to comfort me: <END>
nurse! what should she do here? <END>
my dismal scene i needs must act alone. <END>
come, vial. <END>
what if this mixture do not work at all? <END>
shall i be married then to-morrow morning? <END>
no, no: this shall forbid it: lie thou there. <END>
what if it be a poison, which the friar <END>
subtly hath minister'd to have me dead, <END>
lest in this marriage he should be dishonour'd, <END>
because he married me before to romeo? <END>
i fear it is: and yet, methinks, it should not, <END>
for he hath still been tried a holy man. <END>
how if, when i am laid into the tomb, <END>
i wake before the time that romeo <END>
come to redeem me? there's a fearful point! <END>
shall i not, then, be stifled in the vault, <END>
to whose foul mouth no healthsome air breathes in, <END>
and there die strangled ere my romeo comes? <END>
or, if i live, is it not very like, <END>
the horrible conceit of death and night, <END>
together with the terror of the place,-- <END>
as in a vault, an ancient receptacle, <END>
where, for these many hundred years, the bones <END>
of all my buried ancestors are packed: <END>
where bloody tybalt, yet but green in earth, <END>
lies festering in his shroud; where, as they say, <END>
at some hours in the night spirits resort;-- <END>
alack, alack, is it not like that i, <END>
so early waking, what with loathsome smells, <END>
and shrieks like mandrakes' torn out of the earth, <END>
that living mortals, hearing them, run mad:-- <END>
o, if i wake, shall i not be distraught, <END>
environed with all these hideous fears? <END>
and madly play with my forefather's joints? <END>
and pluck the mangled tybalt from his shroud? <END>
and, in this rage, with some great kinsman's bone, <END>
as with a club, dash out my desperate brains? <END>
o, look! methinks i see my cousin's ghost <END>
seeking out romeo, that did spit his body <END>
upon a rapier's point: stay, tybalt, stay! <END>
romeo, i come! this do i drink to thee. <END>
hold, take these keys, and fetch more spices, nurse. <END>
they call for dates and quinces in the pastry. <END>
come, stir, stir, stir! the second cock hath crow'd, <END>
the curfew-bell hath rung, 'tis three o'clock: <END>
look to the baked meats, good angelica: <END>
spare not for the cost. <END>
go, you cot-quean, go, <END>
get you to bed; faith, you'll be sick to-morrow <END>
for this night's watching. <END>
no, not a whit: what! i have watch'd ere now <END>
all night for lesser cause, and ne'er been sick. <END>
ay, you have been a mouse-hunt in your time; <END>
but i will watch you from such watching now. <END>
a jealous hood, a jealous hood! <END>
now, fellow, <END>
what's there? <END>
things for the cook, sir; but i know not what. <END>
make haste, make haste. <END>
sirrah, fetch drier logs: <END>
call peter, he will show thee where they are. <END>
i have a head, sir, that will find out logs, <END>
and never trouble peter for the matter. <END>
mass, and well said; a merry whoreson, ha! <END>
thou shalt be logger-head. good faith, 'tis day: <END>
the county will be here with music straight, <END>
for so he said he would: i hear him near. <END>
nurse! wife! what, ho! what, nurse, i say! <END>
go waken juliet, go and trim her up; <END>
i'll go and chat with paris: hie, make haste, <END>
make haste; the bridegroom he is come already: <END>
make haste, i say. <END>
mistress! what, mistress! juliet! fast, i warrant her, she: <END>
why, lamb! why, lady! fie, you slug-a-bed! <END>
why, love, i say! madam! sweet-heart! why, bride! <END>
what, not a word? you take your pennyworths now; <END>
sleep for a week; for the next night, i warrant, <END>
the county paris hath set up his rest, <END>
that you shall rest but little. god forgive me, <END>
marry, and amen, how sound is she asleep! <END>
i must needs wake her. madam, madam, madam! <END>
ay, let the county take you in your bed; <END>
he'll fright you up, i' faith. will it not be? <END>
what, dress'd! and in your clothes! and down again! <END>
i must needs wake you; lady! lady! lady! <END>
alas, alas! help, help! my lady's dead! <END>
o, well-a-day, that ever i was born! <END>
some aqua vitae, ho! my lord! my lady! <END>
what noise is here? <END>
o lamentable day! <END>
what is the matter? <END>
look, look! o heavy day! <END>
o me, o me! my child, my only life, <END>
revive, look up, or i will die with thee! <END>
help, help! call help. <END>
for shame, bring juliet forth; her lord is come. <END>
she's dead, deceased, she's dead; alack the day! <END>
alack the day, she's dead, she's dead, she's dead! <END>
ha! let me see her: out, alas! she's cold: <END>
her blood is settled, and her joints are stiff; <END>
life and these lips have long been separated: <END>
death lies on her like an untimely frost <END>
upon the sweetest flower of all the field. <END>
o lamentable day! <END>
o woful time! <END>
death, that hath ta'en her hence to make me wail, <END>
ties up my tongue, and will not let me speak. <END>
come, is the bride ready to go to church? <END>
ready to go, but never to return. <END>
o son! the night before thy wedding-day <END>
hath death lain with thy wife. there she lies, <END>
flower as she was, deflowered by him. <END>
death is my son-in-law, death is my heir; <END>
my daughter he hath wedded: i will die, <END>
and leave him all; life, living, all is death's. <END>
have i thought long to see this morning's face, <END>
and doth it give me such a sight as this? <END>
accursed, unhappy, wretched, hateful day! <END>
most miserable hour that e'er time saw <END>
in lasting labour of his pilgrimage! <END>
but one, poor one, one poor and loving child, <END>
but one thing to rejoice and solace in, <END>
and cruel death hath catch'd it from my sight! <END>
o woe! o woful, woful, woful day! <END>
most lamentable day, most woful day, <END>
that ever, ever, i did yet behold! <END>
o day! o day! o day! o hateful day! <END>
never was seen so black a day as this: <END>
o woful day, o woful day! <END>
beguiled, divorced, wronged, spited, slain! <END>
most detestable death, by thee beguil'd, <END>
by cruel cruel thee quite overthrown! <END>
o love! o life! not life, but love in death! <END>
despised, distressed, hated, martyr'd, kill'd! <END>
uncomfortable time, why camest thou now <END>
to murder, murder our solemnity? <END>
o child! o child! my soul, and not my child! <END>
dead art thou! alack! my child is dead; <END>
and with my child my joys are buried. <END>
peace, ho, for shame! confusion's cure lives not <END>
in these confusions. heaven and yourself <END>
had part in this fair maid; now heaven hath all, <END>
and all the better is it for the maid: <END>
your part in her you could not keep from death, <END>
but heaven keeps his part in eternal life. <END>
the most you sought was her promotion; <END>
for 'twas your heaven she should be advanced: <END>
and weep ye now, seeing she is advanced <END>
above the clouds, as high as heaven itself? <END>
o, in this love, you love your child so ill, <END>
that you run mad, seeing that she is well: <END>
she's not well married that lives married long; <END>
but she's best married that dies married young. <END>
dry up your tears, and stick your rosemary <END>
on this fair corse; and, as the custom is, <END>
in all her best array bear her to church: <END>
for though fond nature bids us an lament, <END>
yet nature's tears are reason's merriment. <END>
all things that we ordained festival, <END>
turn from their office to black funeral; <END>
our instruments to melancholy bells, <END>
our wedding cheer to a sad burial feast, <END>
our solemn hymns to sullen dirges change, <END>
our bridal flowers serve for a buried corse, <END>
and all things change them to the contrary. <END>
sir, go you in; and, madam, go with him; <END>
and go, sir paris; every one prepare <END>
to follow this fair corse unto her grave: <END>
the heavens do lour upon you for some ill; <END>
move them no more by crossing their high will. <END>
faith, we may put up our pipes, and be gone. <END>
honest goodfellows, ah, put up, put up; <END>
for, well you know, this is a pitiful case. <END>
ay, by my troth, the case may be amended. <END>
musicians, o, musicians, 'heart's ease, heart's <END>
ease:' o, an you will have me live, play 'heart's ease.' <END>
why 'heart's ease?' <END>
o, musicians, because my heart itself plays 'my <END>
heart is full of woe:' o, play me some merry dump, <END>
to comfort me. <END>
not a dump we; 'tis no time to play now. <END>
you will not, then? <END>
no. <END>
i will then give it you soundly. <END>
what will you give us? <END>
no money, on my faith, but the gleek; <END>
i will give you the minstrel. <END>
then i will give you the serving-creature. <END>
then will i lay the serving-creature's dagger on <END>
your pate. i will carry no crotchets: i'll re you, <END>
i'll fa you; do you note me? <END>
an you re us and fa us, you note us. <END>
pray you, put up your dagger, and put out your wit. <END>
then have at you with my wit! i will dry-beat you <END>
with an iron wit, and put up my iron dagger. answer <END>
me like men: <END>
'when griping grief the heart doth wound, <END>
and doleful dumps the mind oppress, <END>
then music with her silver sound'-- <END>
why 'silver sound'? why 'music with her silver <END>
sound'? what say you, simon catling? <END>
marry, sir, because silver hath a sweet sound. <END>
pretty! what say you, hugh rebeck? <END>
i say 'silver sound,' because musicians sound for silver. <END>
pretty too! what say you, james soundpost? <END>
faith, i know not what to say. <END>
o, i cry you mercy; you are the singer: i will say <END>
for you. it is 'music with her silver sound,' <END>
because musicians have no gold for sounding: <END>
'then music with her silver sound <END>
with speedy help doth lend redress.' <END>
what a pestilent knave is this same! <END>
hang him, jack! come, we'll in here; tarry for the <END>
mourners, and stay dinner. <END>
if i may trust the flattering truth of sleep, <END>
my dreams presage some joyful news at hand: <END>
my bosom's lord sits lightly in his throne; <END>
and all this day an unaccustom'd spirit <END>
lifts me above the ground with cheerful thoughts. <END>
i dreamt my lady came and found me dead-- <END>
strange dream, that gives a dead man leave <END>
to think!-- <END>
and breathed such life with kisses in my lips, <END>
that i revived, and was an emperor. <END>
ah me! how sweet is love itself possess'd, <END>
when but love's shadows are so rich in joy! <END>
news from verona!--how now, balthasar! <END>
dost thou not bring me letters from the friar? <END>
how doth my lady? is my father well? <END>
how fares my juliet? that i ask again; <END>
for nothing can be ill, if she be well. <END>
then she is well, and nothing can be ill: <END>
her body sleeps in capel's monument, <END>
and her immortal part with angels lives. <END>
i saw her laid low in her kindred's vault, <END>
and presently took post to tell it you: <END>
o, pardon me for bringing these ill news, <END>
since you did leave it for my office, sir. <END>
is it even so? then i defy you, stars! <END>
thou know'st my lodging: get me ink and paper, <END>
and hire post-horses; i will hence to-night. <END>
i do beseech you, sir, have patience: <END>
your looks are pale and wild, and do import <END>
some misadventure. <END>
tush, thou art deceived: <END>
leave me, and do the thing i bid thee do. <END>
hast thou no letters to me from the friar? <END>
no, my good lord. <END>
no matter: get thee gone, <END>
and hire those horses; i'll be with thee straight. <END>
well, juliet, i will lie with thee to-night. <END>
let's see for means: o mischief, thou art swift <END>
to enter in the thoughts of desperate men! <END>
i do remember an apothecary,-- <END>
and hereabouts he dwells,--which late i noted <END>
in tatter'd weeds, with overwhelming brows, <END>
culling of simples; meagre were his looks, <END>
sharp misery had worn him to the bones: <END>
and in his needy shop a tortoise hung, <END>
an alligator stuff'd, and other skins <END>
of ill-shaped fishes; and about his shelves <END>
a beggarly account of empty boxes, <END>
green earthen pots, bladders and musty seeds, <END>
remnants of packthread and old cakes of roses, <END>
were thinly scatter'd, to make up a show. <END>
noting this penury, to myself i said <END>
'an if a man did need a poison now, <END>
whose sale is present death in mantua, <END>
here lives a caitiff wretch would sell it him.' <END>
o, this same thought did but forerun my need; <END>
and this same needy man must sell it me. <END>
as i remember, this should be the house. <END>
being holiday, the beggar's shop is shut. <END>
what, ho! apothecary! <END>
who calls so loud? <END>
come hither, man. i see that thou art poor: <END>
hold, there is forty ducats: let me have <END>
a dram of poison, such soon-speeding gear <END>
as will disperse itself through all the veins <END>
that the life-weary taker may fall dead <END>
and that the trunk may be discharged of breath <END>
as violently as hasty powder fired <END>
doth hurry from the fatal cannon's womb. <END>
such mortal drugs i have; but mantua's law <END>
is death to any he that utters them. <END>
art thou so bare and full of wretchedness, <END>
and fear'st to die? famine is in thy cheeks, <END>
need and oppression starveth in thine eyes, <END>
contempt and beggary hangs upon thy back; <END>
the world is not thy friend nor the world's law; <END>
the world affords no law to make thee rich; <END>
then be not poor, but break it, and take this. <END>
my poverty, but not my will, consents. <END>
i pay thy poverty, and not thy will. <END>
put this in any liquid thing you will, <END>
and drink it off; and, if you had the strength <END>
of twenty men, it would dispatch you straight. <END>
there is thy gold, worse poison to men's souls, <END>
doing more murders in this loathsome world, <END>
than these poor compounds that thou mayst not sell. <END>
i sell thee poison; thou hast sold me none. <END>
come, cordial and not poison, go with me <END>
to juliet's grave; for there must i use thee. <END>
holy franciscan friar! brother, ho! <END>
this same should be the voice of friar john. <END>
welcome from mantua: what says romeo? <END>
or, if his mind be writ, give me his letter. <END>
going to find a bare-foot brother out <END>
one of our order, to associate me, <END>
here in this city visiting the sick, <END>
and finding him, the searchers of the town, <END>
suspecting that we both were in a house <END>
where the infectious pestilence did reign, <END>
seal'd up the doors, and would not let us forth; <END>
so that my speed to mantua there was stay'd. <END>
who bare my letter, then, to romeo? <END>
i could not send it,--here it is again,-- <END>
nor get a messenger to bring it thee, <END>
so fearful were they of infection. <END>
unhappy fortune! by my brotherhood, <END>
the letter was not nice but full of charge <END>
of dear import, and the neglecting it <END>
may do much danger. friar john, go hence; <END>
get me an iron crow, and bring it straight <END>
unto my cell. <END>
brother, i'll go and bring it thee. <END>
now must i to the monument alone; <END>
within three hours will fair juliet wake: <END>
she will beshrew me much that romeo <END>
hath had no notice of these accidents; <END>
but i will write again to mantua, <END>
and keep her at my cell till romeo come; <END>
poor living corse, closed in a dead man's tomb! <END>
give me thy torch, boy: hence, and stand aloof: <END>
yet put it out, for i would not be seen. <END>
under yond yew-trees lay thee all along, <END>
holding thine ear close to the hollow ground; <END>
so shall no foot upon the churchyard tread, <END>
being loose, unfirm, with digging up of graves, <END>
but thou shalt hear it: whistle then to me, <END>
as signal that thou hear'st something approach. <END>
give me those flowers. do as i bid thee, go. <END>
sweet flower, with flowers thy bridal bed i strew,-- <END>
o woe! thy canopy is dust and stones;-- <END>
which with sweet water nightly i will dew, <END>
or, wanting that, with tears distill'd by moans: <END>
the obsequies that i for thee will keep <END>
nightly shall be to strew thy grave and weep. <END>
the boy gives warning something doth approach. <END>
what cursed foot wanders this way to-night, <END>
to cross my obsequies and true love's rite? <END>
what with a torch! muffle me, night, awhile. <END>
give me that mattock and the wrenching iron. <END>
hold, take this letter; early in the morning <END>
see thou deliver it to my lord and father. <END>
give me the light: upon thy life, i charge thee, <END>
whate'er thou hear'st or seest, stand all aloof, <END>
and do not interrupt me in my course. <END>
why i descend into this bed of death, <END>
is partly to behold my lady's face; <END>
but chiefly to take thence from her dead finger <END>
a precious ring, a ring that i must use <END>
in dear employment: therefore hence, be gone: <END>
but if thou, jealous, dost return to pry <END>
in what i further shall intend to do, <END>
by heaven, i will tear thee joint by joint <END>
and strew this hungry churchyard with thy limbs: <END>
the time and my intents are savage-wild, <END>
more fierce and more inexorable far <END>
than empty tigers or the roaring sea. <END>
i will be gone, sir, and not trouble you. <END>
so shalt thou show me friendship. take thou that: <END>
live, and be prosperous: and farewell, good fellow. <END>
thou detestable maw, thou womb of death, <END>
gorged with the dearest morsel of the earth, <END>
thus i enforce thy rotten jaws to open, <END>
and, in despite, i'll cram thee with more food! <END>
this is that banish'd haughty montague, <END>
that murder'd my love's cousin, with which grief, <END>
it is supposed, the fair creature died; <END>
and here is come to do some villanous shame <END>
to the dead bodies: i will apprehend him. <END>
stop thy unhallow'd toil, vile montague! <END>
can vengeance be pursued further than death? <END>
condemned villain, i do apprehend thee: <END>
obey, and go with me; for thou must die. <END>
i must indeed; and therefore came i hither. <END>
good gentle youth, tempt not a desperate man; <END>
fly hence, and leave me: think upon these gone; <END>
let them affright thee. i beseech thee, youth, <END>
put not another sin upon my head, <END>
by urging me to fury: o, be gone! <END>
by heaven, i love thee better than myself; <END>
for i come hither arm'd against myself: <END>
stay not, be gone; live, and hereafter say, <END>
a madman's mercy bade thee run away. <END>
i do defy thy conjurations, <END>
and apprehend thee for a felon here. <END>
wilt thou provoke me? then have at thee, boy! <END>
o lord, they fight! i will go call the watch. <END>
o, i am slain! <END>
if thou be merciful, <END>
open the tomb, lay me with juliet. <END>
in faith, i will. let me peruse this face. <END>
mercutio's kinsman, noble county paris! <END>
what said my man, when my betossed soul <END>
did not attend him as we rode? i think <END>
he told me paris should have married juliet: <END>
said he not so? or did i dream it so? <END>
or am i mad, hearing him talk of juliet, <END>
to think it was so? o, give me thy hand, <END>
one writ with me in sour misfortune's book! <END>
i'll bury thee in a triumphant grave; <END>
a grave? o no! a lantern, slaughter'd youth, <END>
for here lies juliet, and her beauty makes <END>
this vault a feasting presence full of light. <END>
death, lie thou there, by a dead man interr'd. <END>
how oft when men are at the point of death <END>
have they been merry! which their keepers call <END>
a lightning before death: o, how may i <END>
call this a lightning? o my love! my wife! <END>
death, that hath suck'd the honey of thy breath, <END>
hath had no power yet upon thy beauty: <END>
thou art not conquer'd; beauty's ensign yet <END>
is crimson in thy lips and in thy cheeks, <END>
and death's pale flag is not advanced there. <END>
tybalt, liest thou there in thy bloody sheet? <END>
o, what more favour can i do to thee, <END>
than with that hand that cut thy youth in twain <END>
to sunder his that was thine enemy? <END>
forgive me, cousin! ah, dear juliet, <END>
why art thou yet so fair? shall i believe <END>
that unsubstantial death is amorous, <END>
and that the lean abhorred monster keeps <END>
thee here in dark to be his paramour? <END>
for fear of that, i still will stay with thee; <END>
and never from this palace of dim night <END>
depart again: here, here will i remain <END>
with worms that are thy chamber-maids; o, here <END>
will i set up my everlasting rest, <END>
and shake the yoke of inauspicious stars <END>
from this world-wearied flesh. eyes, look your last! <END>
arms, take your last embrace! and, lips, o you <END>
the doors of breath, seal with a righteous kiss <END>
a dateless bargain to engrossing death! <END>
come, bitter conduct, come, unsavoury guide! <END>
thou desperate pilot, now at once run on <END>
the dashing rocks thy sea-sick weary bark! <END>
here's to my love! <END>
o true apothecary! <END>
thy drugs are quick. thus with a kiss i die. <END>
saint francis be my speed! how oft to-night <END>
have my old feet stumbled at graves! who's there? <END>
here's one, a friend, and one that knows you well. <END>
bliss be upon you! tell me, good my friend, <END>
what torch is yond, that vainly lends his light <END>
to grubs and eyeless skulls? as i discern, <END>
it burneth in the capel's monument. <END>
it doth so, holy sir; and there's my master, <END>
one that you love. <END>
who is it? <END>
romeo. <END>
how long hath he been there? <END>
full half an hour. <END>
go with me to the vault. <END>
i dare not, sir <END>
my master knows not but i am gone hence; <END>
and fearfully did menace me with death, <END>
if i did stay to look on his intents. <END>
stay, then; i'll go alone. fear comes upon me: <END>
o, much i fear some ill unlucky thing. <END>
as i did sleep under this yew-tree here, <END>
i dreamt my master and another fought, <END>
and that my master slew him. <END>
romeo! <END>
alack, alack, what blood is this, which stains <END>
the stony entrance of this sepulchre? <END>
what mean these masterless and gory swords <END>
to lie discolour'd by this place of peace? <END>
romeo! o, pale! who else? what, paris too? <END>
and steep'd in blood? ah, what an unkind hour <END>
is guilty of this lamentable chance! <END>
the lady stirs. <END>
o comfortable friar! where is my lord? <END>
i do remember well where i should be, <END>
and there i am. where is my romeo? <END>
i hear some noise. lady, come from that nest <END>
of death, contagion, and unnatural sleep: <END>
a greater power than we can contradict <END>
hath thwarted our intents. come, come away. <END>
thy husband in thy bosom there lies dead; <END>
and paris too. come, i'll dispose of thee <END>
among a sisterhood of holy nuns: <END>
stay not to question, for the watch is coming; <END>
come, go, good juliet, <END>
i dare no longer stay. <END>
go, get thee hence, for i will not away. <END>
what's here? a cup, closed in my true love's hand? <END>
poison, i see, hath been his timeless end: <END>
o churl! drunk all, and left no friendly drop <END>
to help me after? i will kiss thy lips; <END>
haply some poison yet doth hang on them, <END>
to make die with a restorative. <END>
thy lips are warm. <END>
yea, noise? then i'll be brief. o happy dagger! <END>
this is thy sheath; <END>
there rust, and let me die. <END>
this is the place; there, where the torch doth burn. <END>
the ground is bloody; search about the churchyard: <END>
go, some of you, whoe'er you find attach. <END>
pitiful sight! here lies the county slain, <END>
and juliet bleeding, warm, and newly dead, <END>
who here hath lain these two days buried. <END>
go, tell the prince: run to the capulets: <END>
raise up the montagues: some others search: <END>
we see the ground whereon these woes do lie; <END>
but the true ground of all these piteous woes <END>
we cannot without circumstance descry. <END>
here's romeo's man; we found him in the churchyard. <END>
hold him in safety, till the prince come hither. <END>
here is a friar, that trembles, sighs and weeps: <END>
we took this mattock and this spade from him, <END>
as he was coming from this churchyard side. <END>
a great suspicion: stay the friar too. <END>
what misadventure is so early up, <END>
that calls our person from our morning's rest? <END>
what should it be, that they so shriek abroad? <END>
the people in the street cry romeo, <END>
some juliet, and some paris; and all run, <END>
with open outcry toward our monument. <END>
what fear is this which startles in our ears? <END>
sovereign, here lies the county paris slain; <END>
and romeo dead; and juliet, dead before, <END>
warm and new kill'd. <END>
search, seek, and know how this foul murder comes. <END>
here is a friar, and slaughter'd romeo's man; <END>
with instruments upon them, fit to open <END>
these dead men's tombs. <END>
o heavens! o wife, look how our daughter bleeds! <END>
this dagger hath mista'en--for, lo, his house <END>
is empty on the back of montague,-- <END>
and it mis-sheathed in my daughter's bosom! <END>
o me! this sight of death is as a bell, <END>
that warns my old age to a sepulchre. <END>
come, montague; for thou art early up, <END>
to see thy son and heir more early down. <END>
alas, my liege, my wife is dead to-night; <END>
grief of my son's exile hath stopp'd her breath: <END>
what further woe conspires against mine age? <END>
look, and thou shalt see. <END>
o thou untaught! what manners is in this? <END>
to press before thy father to a grave? <END>
seal up the mouth of outrage for a while, <END>
till we can clear these ambiguities, <END>
and know their spring, their head, their <END>
true descent; <END>
and then will i be general of your woes, <END>
and lead you even to death: meantime forbear, <END>
and let mischance be slave to patience. <END>
bring forth the parties of suspicion. <END>
i am the greatest, able to do least, <END>
yet most suspected, as the time and place <END>
doth make against me of this direful murder; <END>
and here i stand, both to impeach and purge <END>
myself condemned and myself excused. <END>
then say at once what thou dost know in this. <END>
i will be brief, for my short date of breath <END>
is not so long as is a tedious tale. <END>
romeo, there dead, was husband to that juliet; <END>
and she, there dead, that romeo's faithful wife: <END>
i married them; and their stol'n marriage-day <END>
was tybalt's dooms-day, whose untimely death <END>
banish'd the new-made bridegroom from the city, <END>
for whom, and not for tybalt, juliet pined. <END>
you, to remove that siege of grief from her, <END>
betroth'd and would have married her perforce <END>
and, with wild looks, bid me devise some mean <END>
to rid her from this second marriage, <END>
or in my cell there would she kill herself. <END>
then gave i her, so tutor'd by my art, <END>
a sleeping potion; which so took effect <END>
as i intended, for it wrought on her <END>
the form of death: meantime i writ to romeo, <END>
that he should hither come as this dire night, <END>
to help to take her from her borrow'd grave, <END>
being the time the potion's force should cease. <END>
but he which bore my letter, friar john, <END>
was stay'd by accident, and yesternight <END>
return'd my letter back. then all alone <END>
at the prefixed hour of her waking, <END>
came i to take her from her kindred's vault; <END>
meaning to keep her closely at my cell, <END>
till i conveniently could send to romeo: <END>
but when i came, some minute ere the time <END>
of her awaking, here untimely lay <END>
the noble paris and true romeo dead. <END>
she wakes; and i entreated her come forth, <END>
and bear this work of heaven with patience: <END>
but then a noise did scare me from the tomb; <END>
and she, too desperate, would not go with me, <END>
but, as it seems, did violence on herself. <END>
all this i know; and to the marriage <END>
her nurse is privy: and, if aught in this <END>
miscarried by my fault, let my old life <END>
be sacrificed, some hour before his time, <END>
unto the rigour of severest law. <END>
we still have known thee for a holy man. <END>
where's romeo's man? what can he say in this? <END>
i brought my master news of juliet's death; <END>
and then in post he came from mantua <END>
to this same place, to this same monument. <END>
this letter he early bid me give his father, <END>
and threatened me with death, going in the vault, <END>
i departed not and left him there. <END>
give me the letter; i will look on it. <END>
where is the county's page, that raised the watch? <END>
sirrah, what made your master in this place? <END>
he came with flowers to strew his lady's grave; <END>
and bid me stand aloof, and so i did: <END>
anon comes one with light to ope the tomb; <END>
and by and by my master drew on him; <END>
and then i ran away to call the watch. <END>
this letter doth make good the friar's words, <END>
their course of love, the tidings of her death: <END>
and here he writes that he did buy a poison <END>
of a poor 'pothecary, and therewithal <END>
came to this vault to die, and lie with juliet. <END>
where be these enemies? capulet! montague! <END>
see, what a scourge is laid upon your hate, <END>
that heaven finds means to kill your joys with love. <END>
and i for winking at your discords too <END>
have lost a brace of kinsmen: all are punish'd. <END>
o brother montague, give me thy hand: <END>
this is my daughter's jointure, for no more <END>
can i demand. <END>
but i can give thee more: <END>
for i will raise her statue in pure gold; <END>
that while verona by that name is known, <END>
there shall no figure at such rate be set <END>
as that of true and faithful juliet. <END>
as rich shall romeo's by his lady's lie; <END>
poor sacrifices of our enmity! <END>
a glooming peace this morning with it brings; <END>
the sun, for sorrow, will not show his head: <END>
go hence, to have more talk of these sad things; <END>
some shall be pardon'd, and some punished: <END>
for never was a story of more woe <END>
than this of juliet and her romeo. <END>
i wonder how the king escaped our hands. <END>
while we pursued the horsemen of the north, <END>
he slily stole away and left his men: <END>
whereat the great lord of northumberland, <END>
whose warlike ears could never brook retreat, <END>
cheer'd up the drooping army; and himself, <END>
lord clifford and lord stafford, all abreast, <END>
charged our main battle's front, and breaking in <END>
were by the swords of common soldiers slain. <END>
lord stafford's father, duke of buckingham, <END>
is either slain or wounded dangerously; <END>
i cleft his beaver with a downright blow: <END>
that this is true, father, behold his blood. <END>
and, brother, here's the earl of wiltshire's blood, <END>
whom i encounter'd as the battles join'd. <END>
speak thou for me and tell them what i did. <END>
richard hath best deserved of all my sons. <END>
but is your grace dead, my lord of somerset? <END>
such hope have all the line of john of gaunt! <END>
thus do i hope to shake king henry's head. <END>
and so do i. victorious prince of york, <END>
before i see thee seated in that throne <END>
which now the house of lancaster usurps, <END>
i vow by heaven these eyes shall never close. <END>
this is the palace of the fearful king, <END>
and this the regal seat: possess it, york; <END>
for this is thine and not king henry's heirs' <END>
assist me, then, sweet warwick, and i will; <END>
for hither we have broken in by force. <END>
we'll all assist you; he that flies shall die. <END>
thanks, gentle norfolk: stay by me, my lords; <END>
and, soldiers, stay and lodge by me this night. <END>
and when the king comes, offer no violence, <END>
unless he seek to thrust you out perforce. <END>
the queen this day here holds her parliament, <END>
but little thinks we shall be of her council: <END>
by words or blows here let us win our right. <END>
arm'd as we are, let's stay within this house. <END>
the bloody parliament shall this be call'd, <END>
unless plantagenet, duke of york, be king, <END>
and bashful henry deposed, whose cowardice <END>
hath made us by-words to our enemies. <END>
then leave me not, my lords; be resolute; <END>
i mean to take possession of my right. <END>
neither the king, nor he that loves him best, <END>
the proudest he that holds up lancaster, <END>
dares stir a wing, if warwick shake his bells. <END>
i'll plant plantagenet, root him up who dares: <END>
resolve thee, richard; claim the english crown. <END>
my lords, look where the sturdy rebel sits, <END>
even in the chair of state: belike he means, <END>
back'd by the power of warwick, that false peer, <END>
to aspire unto the crown and reign as king. <END>
earl of northumberland, he slew thy father. <END>
and thine, lord clifford; and you both have vow'd revenge <END>
on him, his sons, his favourites and his friends. <END>
if i be not, heavens be revenged on me! <END>
the hope thereof makes clifford mourn in steel. <END>
what, shall we suffer this? let's pluck him down: <END>
my heart for anger burns; i cannot brook it. <END>
be patient, gentle earl of westmoreland. <END>
patience is for poltroons, such as he: <END>
he durst not sit there, had your father lived. <END>
my gracious lord, here in the parliament <END>
let us assail the family of york. <END>
well hast thou spoken, cousin: be it so. <END>
ah, know you not the city favours them, <END>
and they have troops of soldiers at their beck? <END>
but when the duke is slain, they'll quickly fly. <END>
far be the thought of this from henry's heart, <END>
to make a shambles of the parliament-house! <END>
cousin of exeter, frowns, words and threats <END>
shall be the war that henry means to use. <END>
thou factious duke of york, descend my throne, <END>
and kneel for grace and mercy at my feet; <END>
i am thy sovereign. <END>
i am thine. <END>
for shame, come down: he made thee duke of york. <END>
'twas my inheritance, as the earldom was. <END>
thy father was a traitor to the crown. <END>
exeter, thou art a traitor to the crown <END>
in following this usurping henry. <END>
whom should he follow but his natural king? <END>
true, clifford; and that's richard duke of york. <END>
and shall i stand, and thou sit in my throne? <END>
it must and shall be so: content thyself. <END>
be duke of lancaster; let him be king. <END>
he is both king and duke of lancaster; <END>
and that the lord of westmoreland shall maintain. <END>
and warwick shall disprove it. you forget <END>
that we are those which chased you from the field <END>
and slew your fathers, and with colours spread <END>
march'd through the city to the palace gates. <END>
yes, warwick, i remember it to my grief; <END>
and, by his soul, thou and thy house shall rue it. <END>
plantagenet, of thee and these thy sons, <END>
thy kinsman and thy friends, i'll have more lives <END>
than drops of blood were in my father's veins. <END>
urge it no more; lest that, instead of words, <END>
i send thee, warwick, such a messenger <END>
as shall revenge his death before i stir. <END>
poor clifford! how i scorn his worthless threats! <END>
will you we show our title to the crown? <END>
if not, our swords shall plead it in the field. <END>
what title hast thou, traitor, to the crown? <END>
thy father was, as thou art, duke of york; <END>
thy grandfather, roger mortimer, earl of march: <END>
i am the son of henry the fifth, <END>
who made the dauphin and the french to stoop <END>
and seized upon their towns and provinces. <END>
talk not of france, sith thou hast lost it all. <END>
the lord protector lost it, and not i: <END>
when i was crown'd i was but nine months old. <END>
you are old enough now, and yet, methinks, you lose. <END>
father, tear the crown from the usurper's head. <END>
sweet father, do so; set it on your head. <END>
good brother, as thou lovest and honourest arms, <END>
let's fight it out and not stand cavilling thus. <END>
sound drums and trumpets, and the king will fly. <END>
sons, peace! <END>
peace, thou! and give king henry leave to speak. <END>
plantagenet shall speak first: hear him, lords; <END>
and be you silent and attentive too, <END>
for he that interrupts him shall not live. <END>
think'st thou that i will leave my kingly throne, <END>
wherein my grandsire and my father sat? <END>
ay, and their colours, often borne in france, <END>
and now in england to our heart's great sorrow, <END>
shall be my winding-sheet. why faint you, lords? <END>
my title's good, and better far than his. <END>
prove it, henry, and thou shalt be king. <END>
henry the fourth by conquest got the crown. <END>
'twas by rebellion against his king. <END>
what then? <END>
an if he may, then am i lawful king; <END>
for richard, in the view of many lords, <END>
resign'd the crown to henry the fourth, <END>
whose heir my father was, and i am his. <END>
he rose against him, being his sovereign, <END>
and made him to resign his crown perforce. <END>
suppose, my lords, he did it unconstrain'd, <END>
think you 'twere prejudicial to his crown? <END>
no; for he could not so resign his crown <END>
but that the next heir should succeed and reign. <END>
art thou against us, duke of exeter? <END>
his is the right, and therefore pardon me. <END>
why whisper you, my lords, and answer not? <END>
my conscience tells me he is lawful king. <END>
plantagenet, for all the claim thou lay'st, <END>
think not that henry shall be so deposed. <END>
deposed he shall be, in despite of all. <END>
thou art deceived: 'tis not thy southern power, <END>
of essex, norfolk, suffolk, nor of kent, <END>
which makes thee thus presumptuous and proud, <END>
can set the duke up in despite of me. <END>
king henry, be thy title right or wrong, <END>
lord clifford vows to fight in thy defence: <END>
may that ground gape and swallow me alive, <END>
where i shall kneel to him that slew my father! <END>
o clifford, how thy words revive my heart! <END>
henry of lancaster, resign thy crown. <END>
what mutter you, or what conspire you, lords? <END>
do right unto this princely duke of york, <END>
or i will fill the house with armed men, <END>
and over the chair of state, where now he sits, <END>
write up his title with usurping blood. <END>
my lord of warwick, hear me but one word: <END>
let me for this my life-time reign as king. <END>
confirm the crown to me and to mine heirs, <END>
and thou shalt reign in quiet while thou livest. <END>
i am content: richard plantagenet, <END>
enjoy the kingdom after my decease. <END>
what wrong is this unto the prince your son! <END>
what good is this to england and himself! <END>
base, fearful and despairing henry! <END>
how hast thou injured both thyself and us! <END>
i cannot stay to hear these articles. <END>
nor i. <END>
come, cousin, let us tell the queen these news. <END>
farewell, faint-hearted and degenerate king, <END>
in whose cold blood no spark of honour bides. <END>
be thou a prey unto the house of york, <END>
and die in bands for this unmanly deed! <END>
in dreadful war mayst thou be overcome, <END>
or live in peace abandon'd and despised! <END>
turn this way, henry, and regard them not. <END>
they seek revenge and therefore will not yield. <END>
ah, exeter! <END>
why should you sigh, my lord? <END>
not for myself, lord warwick, but my son, <END>
whom i unnaturally shall disinherit. <END>
but be it as it may: i here entail <END>
the crown to thee and to thine heirs for ever; <END>
conditionally, that here thou take an oath <END>
to cease this civil war, and, whilst i live, <END>
to honour me as thy king and sovereign, <END>
and neither by treason nor hostility <END>
to seek to put me down and reign thyself. <END>
this oath i willingly take and will perform. <END>
long live king henry! plantagenet embrace him. <END>
and long live thou and these thy forward sons! <END>
now york and lancaster are reconciled. <END>
accursed be he that seeks to make them foes! <END>
farewell, my gracious lord; i'll to my castle. <END>
and i'll keep london with my soldiers. <END>
and i to norfolk with my followers. <END>
and i unto the sea from whence i came. <END>
and i, with grief and sorrow, to the court. <END>
here comes the queen, whose looks bewray her anger: <END>
i'll steal away. <END>
exeter, so will i. <END>
nay, go not from me; i will follow thee. <END>
be patient, gentle queen, and i will stay. <END>
who can be patient in such extremes? <END>
ah, wretched man! would i had died a maid <END>
and never seen thee, never borne thee son, <END>
seeing thou hast proved so unnatural a father <END>
hath he deserved to lose his birthright thus? <END>
hadst thou but loved him half so well as i, <END>
or felt that pain which i did for him once, <END>
or nourish'd him as i did with my blood, <END>
thou wouldst have left thy dearest heart-blood there, <END>
rather than have that savage duke thine heir <END>
and disinherited thine only son. <END>
father, you cannot disinherit me: <END>
if you be king, why should not i succeed? <END>
pardon me, margaret; pardon me, sweet son: <END>
the earl of warwick and the duke enforced me. <END>
enforced thee! art thou king, and wilt be forced? <END>
i shame to hear thee speak. ah, timorous wretch! <END>
thou hast undone thyself, thy son and me; <END>
and given unto the house of york such head <END>
as thou shalt reign but by their sufferance. <END>
to entail him and his heirs unto the crown, <END>
what is it, but to make thy sepulchre <END>
and creep into it far before thy time? <END>
warwick is chancellor and the lord of calais; <END>
stern falconbridge commands the narrow seas; <END>
the duke is made protector of the realm; <END>
and yet shalt thou be safe? such safety finds <END>
the trembling lamb environed with wolves. <END>
had i been there, which am a silly woman, <END>
the soldiers should have toss'd me on their pikes <END>
before i would have granted to that act. <END>
but thou preferr'st thy life before thine honour: <END>
and seeing thou dost, i here divorce myself <END>
both from thy table, henry, and thy bed, <END>
until that act of parliament be repeal'd <END>
whereby my son is disinherited. <END>
the northern lords that have forsworn thy colours <END>
will follow mine, if once they see them spread; <END>
and spread they shall be, to thy foul disgrace <END>
and utter ruin of the house of york. <END>
thus do i leave thee. come, son, let's away; <END>
our army is ready; come, we'll after them. <END>
stay, gentle margaret, and hear me speak. <END>
thou hast spoke too much already: get thee gone. <END>
gentle son edward, thou wilt stay with me? <END>
ay, to be murder'd by his enemies. <END>
when i return with victory from the field <END>
i'll see your grace: till then i'll follow her. <END>
come, son, away; we may not linger thus. <END>
poor queen! how love to me and to her son <END>
hath made her break out into terms of rage! <END>
revenged may she be on that hateful duke, <END>
whose haughty spirit, winged with desire, <END>
will cost my crown, and like an empty eagle <END>
tire on the flesh of me and of my son! <END>
the loss of those three lords torments my heart: <END>
i'll write unto them and entreat them fair. <END>
come, cousin you shall be the messenger. <END>
and i, i hope, shall reconcile them all. <END>
3 king henry vi <END>
brother, though i be youngest, give me leave. <END>
no, i can better play the orator. <END>
but i have reasons strong and forcible. <END>
why, how now, sons and brother! at a strife? <END>
what is your quarrel? how began it first? <END>
no quarrel, but a slight contention. <END>
about what? <END>
about that which concerns your grace and us; <END>
the crown of england, father, which is yours. <END>
mine boy? not till king henry be dead. <END>
your right depends not on his life or death. <END>
now you are heir, therefore enjoy it now: <END>
by giving the house of lancaster leave to breathe, <END>
it will outrun you, father, in the end. <END>
i took an oath that he should quietly reign. <END>
but for a kingdom any oath may be broken: <END>
i would break a thousand oaths to reign one year. <END>
no; god forbid your grace should be forsworn. <END>
i shall be, if i claim by open war. <END>
i'll prove the contrary, if you'll hear me speak. <END>
thou canst not, son; it is impossible. <END>
an oath is of no moment, being not took <END>
before a true and lawful magistrate, <END>
that hath authority over him that swears: <END>
henry had none, but did usurp the place; <END>
then, seeing 'twas he that made you to depose, <END>
your oath, my lord, is vain and frivolous. <END>
therefore, to arms! and, father, do but think <END>
how sweet a thing it is to wear a crown; <END>
within whose circuit is elysium <END>
and all that poets feign of bliss and joy. <END>
why do we finger thus? i cannot rest <END>
until the white rose that i wear be dyed <END>
even in the lukewarm blood of henry's heart. <END>
richard, enough; i will be king, or die. <END>
brother, thou shalt to london presently, <END>
and whet on warwick to this enterprise. <END>
thou, richard, shalt to the duke of norfolk, <END>
and tell him privily of our intent. <END>
you edward, shall unto my lord cobham, <END>
with whom the kentishmen will willingly rise: <END>
in them i trust; for they are soldiers, <END>
witty, courteous, liberal, full of spirit. <END>
while you are thus employ'd, what resteth more, <END>
but that i seek occasion how to rise, <END>
and yet the king not privy to my drift, <END>
nor any of the house of lancaster? <END>
but, stay: what news? why comest thou in such post? <END>
the queen with all the northern earls and lords <END>
intend here to besiege you in your castle: <END>
she is hard by with twenty thousand men; <END>
and therefore fortify your hold, my lord. <END>
ay, with my sword. what! think'st thou that we fear them? <END>
edward and richard, you shall stay with me; <END>
my brother montague shall post to london: <END>
let noble warwick, cobham, and the rest, <END>
whom we have left protectors of the king, <END>
with powerful policy strengthen themselves, <END>
and trust not simple henry nor his oaths. <END>
brother, i go; i'll win them, fear it not: <END>
and thus most humbly i do take my leave. <END>
sir john and sir hugh mortimer, mine uncles, <END>
you are come to sandal in a happy hour; <END>
the army of the queen mean to besiege us. <END>
she shall not need; we'll meet her in the field. <END>
what, with five thousand men? <END>
ay, with five hundred, father, for a need: <END>
a woman's general; what should we fear? <END>
i hear their drums: let's set our men in order, <END>
and issue forth and bid them battle straight. <END>
five men to twenty! though the odds be great, <END>
i doubt not, uncle, of our victory. <END>
many a battle have i won in france, <END>
when as the enemy hath been ten to one: <END>
why should i not now have the like success? <END>
3 king henry vi <END>
ah, whither shall i fly to 'scape their hands? <END>
ah, tutor, look where bloody clifford comes! <END>
chaplain, away! thy priesthood saves thy life. <END>
as for the brat of this accursed duke, <END>
whose father slew my father, he shall die. <END>
and i, my lord, will bear him company. <END>
soldiers, away with him! <END>
ah, clifford, murder not this innocent child, <END>
lest thou be hated both of god and man! <END>
how now! is he dead already? or is it fear <END>
that makes him close his eyes? i'll open them. <END>
so looks the pent-up lion o'er the wretch <END>
that trembles under his devouring paws; <END>
and so he walks, insulting o'er his prey, <END>
and so he comes, to rend his limbs asunder. <END>
ah, gentle clifford, kill me with thy sword, <END>
and not with such a cruel threatening look. <END>
sweet clifford, hear me speak before i die. <END>
i am too mean a subject for thy wrath: <END>
be thou revenged on men, and let me live. <END>
in vain thou speak'st, poor boy; my father's blood <END>
hath stopp'd the passage where thy words should enter. <END>
then let my father's blood open it again: <END>
he is a man, and, clifford, cope with him. <END>
had thy brethren here, their lives and thine <END>
were not revenge sufficient for me; <END>
no, if i digg'd up thy forefathers' graves <END>
and hung their rotten coffins up in chains, <END>
it could not slake mine ire, nor ease my heart. <END>
the sight of any of the house of york <END>
is as a fury to torment my soul; <END>
and till i root out their accursed line <END>
and leave not one alive, i live in hell. <END>
therefore-- <END>
o, let me pray before i take my death! <END>
to thee i pray; sweet clifford, pity me! <END>
such pity as my rapier's point affords. <END>
i never did thee harm: why wilt thou slay me? <END>
thy father hath. <END>
but 'twas ere i was born. <END>
thou hast one son; for his sake pity me, <END>
lest in revenge thereof, sith god is just, <END>
he be as miserably slain as i. <END>
ah, let me live in prison all my days; <END>
and when i give occasion of offence, <END>
then let me die, for now thou hast no cause. <END>
no cause! <END>
thy father slew my father; therefore, die. <END>
di faciant laudis summa sit ista tuae! <END>
plantagenet! i come, plantagenet! <END>
and this thy son's blood cleaving to my blade <END>
shall rust upon my weapon, till thy blood, <END>
congeal'd with this, do make me wipe off both. <END>
3 king henry vi <END>
the army of the queen hath got the field: <END>
my uncles both are slain in rescuing me; <END>
and all my followers to the eager foe <END>
turn back and fly, like ships before the wind <END>
or lambs pursued by hunger-starved wolves. <END>
my sons, god knows what hath bechanced them: <END>
but this i know, they have demean'd themselves <END>
like men born to renown by life or death. <END>
three times did richard make a lane to me. <END>
and thrice cried 'courage, father! fight it out!' <END>
and full as oft came edward to my side, <END>
with purple falchion, painted to the hilt <END>
in blood of those that had encounter'd him: <END>
and when the hardiest warriors did retire, <END>
richard cried 'charge! and give no foot of ground!' <END>
and cried 'a crown, or else a glorious tomb! <END>
a sceptre, or an earthly sepulchre!' <END>
with this, we charged again: but, out, alas! <END>
we bodged again; as i have seen a swan <END>
with bootless labour swim against the tide <END>
and spend her strength with over-matching waves. <END>
ah, hark! the fatal followers do pursue; <END>
and i am faint and cannot fly their fury: <END>
and were i strong, i would not shun their fury: <END>
the sands are number'd that make up my life; <END>
here must i stay, and here my life must end. <END>
come, bloody clifford, rough northumberland, <END>
i dare your quenchless fury to more rage: <END>
i am your butt, and i abide your shot. <END>
yield to our mercy, proud plantagenet. <END>
ay, to such mercy as his ruthless arm, <END>
with downright payment, show'd unto my father. <END>
now phaethon hath tumbled from his car, <END>
and made an evening at the noontide prick. <END>
my ashes, as the phoenix, may bring forth <END>
a bird that will revenge upon you all: <END>
and in that hope i throw mine eyes to heaven, <END>
scorning whate'er you can afflict me with. <END>
why come you not? what! multitudes, and fear? <END>
so cowards fight when they can fly no further; <END>
so doves do peck the falcon's piercing talons; <END>
so desperate thieves, all hopeless of their lives, <END>
breathe out invectives 'gainst the officers. <END>
o clifford, but bethink thee once again, <END>
and in thy thought o'er-run my former time; <END>
and, if though canst for blushing, view this face, <END>
and bite thy tongue, that slanders him with cowardice <END>
whose frown hath made thee faint and fly ere this! <END>
i will not bandy with thee word for word, <END>
but buckle with thee blows, twice two for one. <END>
hold, valiant clifford! for a thousand causes <END>
i would prolong awhile the traitor's life. <END>
wrath makes him deaf: speak thou, northumberland. <END>
hold, clifford! do not honour him so much <END>
to prick thy finger, though to wound his heart: <END>
what valour were it, when a cur doth grin, <END>
for one to thrust his hand between his teeth, <END>
when he might spurn him with his foot away? <END>
it is war's prize to take all vantages; <END>
and ten to one is no impeach of valour. <END>
ay, ay, so strives the woodcock with the gin. <END>
so doth the cony struggle in the net. <END>
so triumph thieves upon their conquer'd booty; <END>
so true men yield, with robbers so o'ermatch'd. <END>
what would your grace have done unto him now? <END>
brave warriors, clifford and northumberland, <END>
come, make him stand upon this molehill here, <END>
that raught at mountains with outstretched arms, <END>
yet parted but the shadow with his hand. <END>
what! was it you that would be england's king? <END>
was't you that revell'd in our parliament, <END>
and made a preachment of your high descent? <END>
where are your mess of sons to back you now? <END>
the wanton edward, and the lusty george? <END>
and where's that valiant crook-back prodigy, <END>
dicky your boy, that with his grumbling voice <END>
was wont to cheer his dad in mutinies? <END>
or, with the rest, where is your darling rutland? <END>
look, york: i stain'd this napkin with the blood <END>
that valiant clifford, with his rapier's point, <END>
made issue from the bosom of the boy; <END>
and if thine eyes can water for his death, <END>
i give thee this to dry thy cheeks withal. <END>
alas poor york! but that i hate thee deadly, <END>
i should lament thy miserable state. <END>
i prithee, grieve, to make me merry, york. <END>
what, hath thy fiery heart so parch'd thine entrails <END>
that not a tear can fall for rutland's death? <END>
why art thou patient, man? thou shouldst be mad; <END>
and i, to make thee mad, do mock thee thus. <END>
stamp, rave, and fret, that i may sing and dance. <END>
thou wouldst be fee'd, i see, to make me sport: <END>
york cannot speak, unless he wear a crown. <END>
a crown for york! and, lords, bow low to him: <END>
hold you his hands, whilst i do set it on. <END>
ay, marry, sir, now looks he like a king! <END>
ay, this is he that took king henry's chair, <END>
and this is he was his adopted heir. <END>
but how is it that great plantagenet <END>
is crown'd so soon, and broke his solemn oath? <END>
as i bethink me, you should not be king <END>
till our king henry had shook hands with death. <END>
and will you pale your head in henry's glory, <END>
and rob his temples of the diadem, <END>
now in his life, against your holy oath? <END>
o, 'tis a fault too too unpardonable! <END>
off with the crown, and with the crown his head; <END>
and, whilst we breathe, take time to do him dead. <END>
that is my office, for my father's sake. <END>
nay, stay; lets hear the orisons he makes. <END>
she-wolf of france, but worse than wolves of france, <END>
whose tongue more poisons than the adder's tooth! <END>
how ill-beseeming is it in thy sex <END>
to triumph, like an amazonian trull, <END>
upon their woes whom fortune captivates! <END>
but that thy face is, vizard-like, unchanging, <END>
made impudent with use of evil deeds, <END>
i would assay, proud queen, to make thee blush. <END>
to tell thee whence thou camest, of whom derived, <END>
were shame enough to shame thee, wert thou not shameless. <END>
thy father bears the type of king of naples, <END>
of both the sicils and jerusalem, <END>
yet not so wealthy as an english yeoman. <END>
hath that poor monarch taught thee to insult? <END>
it needs not, nor it boots thee not, proud queen, <END>
unless the adage must be verified, <END>
that beggars mounted run their horse to death. <END>
'tis beauty that doth oft make women proud; <END>
but, god he knows, thy share thereof is small: <END>
'tis virtue that doth make them most admired; <END>
the contrary doth make thee wonder'd at: <END>
'tis government that makes them seem divine; <END>
the want thereof makes thee abominable: <END>
thou art as opposite to every good <END>
as the antipodes are unto us, <END>
or as the south to the septentrion. <END>
o tiger's heart wrapt in a woman's hide! <END>
how couldst thou drain the life-blood of the child, <END>
to bid the father wipe his eyes withal, <END>
and yet be seen to bear a woman's face? <END>
women are soft, mild, pitiful and flexible; <END>
thou stern, obdurate, flinty, rough, remorseless. <END>
bids't thou me rage? why, now thou hast thy wish: <END>
wouldst have me weep? why, now thou hast thy will: <END>
for raging wind blows up incessant showers, <END>
and when the rage allays, the rain begins. <END>
these tears are my sweet rutland's obsequies: <END>
and every drop cries vengeance for his death, <END>
'gainst thee, fell clifford, and thee, false <END>
frenchwoman. <END>
beshrew me, but his passion moves me so <END>
that hardly can i cheque my eyes from tears. <END>
that face of his the hungry cannibals <END>
would not have touch'd, would not have stain'd with blood: <END>
but you are more inhuman, more inexorable, <END>
o, ten times more, than tigers of hyrcania. <END>
see, ruthless queen, a hapless father's tears: <END>
this cloth thou dip'dst in blood of my sweet boy, <END>
and i with tears do wash the blood away. <END>
keep thou the napkin, and go boast of this: <END>
and if thou tell'st the heavy story right, <END>
upon my soul, the hearers will shed tears; <END>
yea even my foes will shed fast-falling tears, <END>
and say 'alas, it was a piteous deed!' <END>
there, take the crown, and, with the crown, my curse; <END>
and in thy need such comfort come to thee <END>
as now i reap at thy too cruel hand! <END>
hard-hearted clifford, take me from the world: <END>
my soul to heaven, my blood upon your heads! <END>
had he been slaughter-man to all my kin, <END>
i should not for my life but weep with him. <END>
to see how inly sorrow gripes his soul. <END>
what, weeping-ripe, my lord northumberland? <END>
think but upon the wrong he did us all, <END>
and that will quickly dry thy melting tears. <END>
here's for my oath, here's for my father's death. <END>
and here's to right our gentle-hearted king. <END>
open thy gate of mercy, gracious god! <END>
my soul flies through these wounds to seek out thee. <END>
off with his head, and set it on york gates; <END>
so york may overlook the town of york. <END>
3 king henry vi <END>
i wonder how our princely father 'scaped, <END>
or whether he be 'scaped away or no <END>
from clifford's and northumberland's pursuit: <END>
had he been ta'en, we should have heard the news; <END>
had he been slain, we should have heard the news; <END>
or had he 'scaped, methinks we should have heard <END>
the happy tidings of his good escape. <END>
how fares my brother? why is he so sad? <END>
i cannot joy, until i be resolved <END>
where our right valiant father is become. <END>
i saw him in the battle range about; <END>
and watch'd him how he singled clifford forth. <END>
methought he bore him in the thickest troop <END>
as doth a lion in a herd of neat; <END>
or as a bear, encompass'd round with dogs, <END>
who having pinch'd a few and made them cry, <END>
the rest stand all aloof, and bark at him. <END>
so fared our father with his enemies; <END>
so fled his enemies my warlike father: <END>
methinks, 'tis prize enough to be his son. <END>
see how the morning opes her golden gates, <END>
and takes her farewell of the glorious sun! <END>
how well resembles it the prime of youth, <END>
trimm'd like a younker prancing to his love! <END>
dazzle mine eyes, or do i see three suns? <END>
three glorious suns, each one a perfect sun; <END>
not separated with the racking clouds, <END>
but sever'd in a pale clear-shining sky. <END>
see, see! they join, embrace, and seem to kiss, <END>
as if they vow'd some league inviolable: <END>
now are they but one lamp, one light, one sun. <END>
in this the heaven figures some event. <END>
'tis wondrous strange, the like yet never heard of. <END>
i think it cites us, brother, to the field, <END>
that we, the sons of brave plantagenet, <END>
each one already blazing by our meeds, <END>
should notwithstanding join our lights together <END>
and over-shine the earth as this the world. <END>
whate'er it bodes, henceforward will i bear <END>
upon my target three fair-shining suns. <END>
nay, bear three daughters: by your leave i speak it, <END>
you love the breeder better than the male. <END>
but what art thou, whose heavy looks foretell <END>
some dreadful story hanging on thy tongue? <END>
ah, one that was a woful looker-on <END>
when as the noble duke of york was slain, <END>
your princely father and my loving lord! <END>
o, speak no more, for i have heard too much. <END>
say how he died, for i will hear it all. <END>
environed he was with many foes, <END>
and stood against them, as the hope of troy <END>
against the greeks that would have enter'd troy. <END>
but hercules himself must yield to odds; <END>
and many strokes, though with a little axe, <END>
hew down and fell the hardest-timber'd oak. <END>
by many hands your father was subdued; <END>
but only slaughter'd by the ireful arm <END>
of unrelenting clifford and the queen, <END>
who crown'd the gracious duke in high despite, <END>
laugh'd in his face; and when with grief he wept, <END>
the ruthless queen gave him to dry his cheeks <END>
a napkin steeped in the harmless blood <END>
of sweet young rutland, by rough clifford slain: <END>
and after many scorns, many foul taunts, <END>
they took his head, and on the gates of york <END>
they set the same; and there it doth remain, <END>
the saddest spectacle that e'er i view'd. <END>
sweet duke of york, our prop to lean upon, <END>
now thou art gone, we have no staff, no stay. <END>
o clifford, boisterous clifford! thou hast slain <END>
the flower of europe for his chivalry; <END>
and treacherously hast thou vanquish'd him, <END>
for hand to hand he would have vanquish'd thee. <END>
now my soul's palace is become a prison: <END>
ah, would she break from hence, that this my body <END>
might in the ground be closed up in rest! <END>
for never henceforth shall i joy again, <END>
never, o never shall i see more joy! <END>
i cannot weep; for all my body's moisture <END>
scarce serves to quench my furnace-burning heart: <END>
nor can my tongue unload my heart's great burthen; <END>
for selfsame wind that i should speak withal <END>
is kindling coals that fires all my breast, <END>
and burns me up with flames that tears would quench. <END>
to weep is to make less the depth of grief: <END>
tears then for babes; blows and revenge for me <END>
richard, i bear thy name; i'll venge thy death, <END>
or die renowned by attempting it. <END>
his name that valiant duke hath left with thee; <END>
his dukedom and his chair with me is left. <END>
nay, if thou be that princely eagle's bird, <END>
show thy descent by gazing 'gainst the sun: <END>
for chair and dukedom, throne and kingdom say; <END>
either that is thine, or else thou wert not his. <END>
how now, fair lords! what fare? what news abroad? <END>
great lord of warwick, if we should recount <END>
our baleful news, and at each word's deliverance <END>
stab poniards in our flesh till all were told, <END>
the words would add more anguish than the wounds. <END>
o valiant lord, the duke of york is slain! <END>
o warwick, warwick! that plantagenet, <END>
which held three dearly as his soul's redemption, <END>
is by the stern lord clifford done to death. <END>
ten days ago i drown'd these news in tears; <END>
and now, to add more measure to your woes, <END>
i come to tell you things sith then befall'n. <END>
after the bloody fray at wakefield fought, <END>
where your brave father breathed his latest gasp, <END>
tidings, as swiftly as the posts could run, <END>
were brought me of your loss and his depart. <END>
i, then in london keeper of the king, <END>
muster'd my soldiers, gather'd flocks of friends, <END>
and very well appointed, as i thought, <END>
march'd toward saint alban's to intercept the queen, <END>
bearing the king in my behalf along; <END>
for by my scouts i was advertised <END>
that she was coming with a full intent <END>
to dash our late decree in parliament <END>
touching king henry's oath and your succession. <END>
short tale to make, we at saint alban's met <END>
our battles join'd, and both sides fiercely fought: <END>
but whether 'twas the coldness of the king, <END>
who look'd full gently on his warlike queen, <END>
that robb'd my soldiers of their heated spleen; <END>
or whether 'twas report of her success; <END>
or more than common fear of clifford's rigour, <END>
who thunders to his captives blood and death, <END>
i cannot judge: but to conclude with truth, <END>
their weapons like to lightning came and went; <END>
our soldiers', like the night-owl's lazy flight, <END>
or like an idle thresher with a flail, <END>
fell gently down, as if they struck their friends. <END>
i cheer'd them up with justice of our cause, <END>
with promise of high pay and great rewards: <END>
but all in vain; they had no heart to fight, <END>
and we in them no hope to win the day; <END>
so that we fled; the king unto the queen; <END>
lord george your brother, norfolk and myself, <END>
in haste, post-haste, are come to join with you: <END>
for in the marches here we heard you were, <END>
making another head to fight again. <END>
where is the duke of norfolk, gentle warwick? <END>
and when came george from burgundy to england? <END>
some six miles off the duke is with the soldiers; <END>
and for your brother, he was lately sent <END>
from your kind aunt, duchess of burgundy, <END>
with aid of soldiers to this needful war. <END>
'twas odds, belike, when valiant warwick fled: <END>
oft have i heard his praises in pursuit, <END>
but ne'er till now his scandal of retire. <END>
nor now my scandal, richard, dost thou hear; <END>
for thou shalt know this strong right hand of mine <END>
can pluck the diadem from faint henry's head, <END>
and wring the awful sceptre from his fist, <END>
were he as famous and as bold in war <END>
as he is famed for mildness, peace, and prayer. <END>
i know it well, lord warwick; blame me not: <END>
'tis love i bear thy glories makes me speak. <END>
but in this troublous time what's to be done? <END>
shall we go throw away our coats of steel, <END>
and wrap our bodies in black mourning gowns, <END>
numbering our ave-maries with our beads? <END>
or shall we on the helmets of our foes <END>
tell our devotion with revengeful arms? <END>
if for the last, say ay, and to it, lords. <END>
why, therefore warwick came to seek you out; <END>
and therefore comes my brother montague. <END>
attend me, lords. the proud insulting queen, <END>
with clifford and the haught northumberland, <END>
and of their feather many more proud birds, <END>
have wrought the easy-melting king like wax. <END>
he swore consent to your succession, <END>
his oath enrolled in the parliament; <END>
and now to london all the crew are gone, <END>
to frustrate both his oath and what beside <END>
may make against the house of lancaster. <END>
their power, i think, is thirty thousand strong: <END>
now, if the help of norfolk and myself, <END>
with all the friends that thou, brave earl of march, <END>
amongst the loving welshmen canst procure, <END>
will but amount to five and twenty thousand, <END>
why, via! to london will we march amain, <END>
and once again bestride our foaming steeds, <END>
and once again cry 'charge upon our foes!' <END>
but never once again turn back and fly. <END>
ay, now methinks i hear great warwick speak: <END>
ne'er may he live to see a sunshine day, <END>
that cries 'retire,' if warwick bid him stay. <END>
lord warwick, on thy shoulder will i lean; <END>
and when thou fail'st--as god forbid the hour!-- <END>
must edward fall, which peril heaven forfend! <END>
no longer earl of march, but duke of york: <END>
the next degree is england's royal throne; <END>
for king of england shalt thou be proclaim'd <END>
in every borough as we pass along; <END>
and he that throws not up his cap for joy <END>
shall for the fault make forfeit of his head. <END>
king edward, valiant richard, montague, <END>
stay we no longer, dreaming of renown, <END>
but sound the trumpets, and about our task. <END>
then, clifford, were thy heart as hard as steel, <END>
as thou hast shown it flinty by thy deeds, <END>
i come to pierce it, or to give thee mine. <END>
then strike up drums: god and saint george for us! <END>
how now! what news? <END>
the duke of norfolk sends you word by me, <END>
the queen is coming with a puissant host; <END>
and craves your company for speedy counsel. <END>
why then it sorts, brave warriors, let's away. <END>
3 king henry vi <END>
welcome, my lord, to this brave town of york. <END>
yonder's the head of that arch-enemy <END>
that sought to be encompass'd with your crown: <END>
doth not the object cheer your heart, my lord? <END>
ay, as the rocks cheer them that fear their wreck: <END>
to see this sight, it irks my very soul. <END>
withhold revenge, dear god! 'tis not my fault, <END>
nor wittingly have i infringed my vow. <END>
my gracious liege, this too much lenity <END>
and harmful pity must be laid aside. <END>
to whom do lions cast their gentle looks? <END>
not to the beast that would usurp their den. <END>
whose hand is that the forest bear doth lick? <END>
not his that spoils her young before her face. <END>
who 'scapes the lurking serpent's mortal sting? <END>
not he that sets his foot upon her back. <END>
the smallest worm will turn being trodden on, <END>
and doves will peck in safeguard of their brood. <END>
ambitious york doth level at thy crown, <END>
thou smiling while he knit his angry brows: <END>
he, but a duke, would have his son a king, <END>
and raise his issue, like a loving sire; <END>
thou, being a king, blest with a goodly son, <END>
didst yield consent to disinherit him, <END>
which argued thee a most unloving father. <END>
unreasonable creatures feed their young; <END>
and though man's face be fearful to their eyes, <END>
yet, in protection of their tender ones, <END>
who hath not seen them, even with those wings <END>
which sometime they have used with fearful flight, <END>
make war with him that climb'd unto their nest, <END>
offer their own lives in their young's defence? <END>
for shame, my liege, make them your precedent! <END>
were it not pity that this goodly boy <END>
should lose his birthright by his father's fault, <END>
and long hereafter say unto his child, <END>
'what my great-grandfather and his grandsire got <END>
my careless father fondly gave away'? <END>
ah, what a shame were this! look on the boy; <END>
and let his manly face, which promiseth <END>
successful fortune, steel thy melting heart <END>
to hold thine own and leave thine own with him. <END>
full well hath clifford play'd the orator, <END>
inferring arguments of mighty force. <END>
but, clifford, tell me, didst thou never hear <END>
that things ill-got had ever bad success? <END>
and happy always was it for that son <END>
whose father for his hoarding went to hell? <END>
i'll leave my son my virtuous deeds behind; <END>
and would my father had left me no more! <END>
for all the rest is held at such a rate <END>
as brings a thousand-fold more care to keep <END>
than in possession and jot of pleasure. <END>
ah, cousin york! would thy best friends did know <END>
how it doth grieve me that thy head is here! <END>
my lord, cheer up your spirits: our foes are nigh, <END>
and this soft courage makes your followers faint. <END>
you promised knighthood to our forward son: <END>
unsheathe your sword, and dub him presently. <END>
edward, kneel down. <END>
edward plantagenet, arise a knight; <END>
and learn this lesson, draw thy sword in right. <END>
my gracious father, by your kingly leave, <END>
i'll draw it as apparent to the crown, <END>
and in that quarrel use it to the death. <END>
why, that is spoken like a toward prince. <END>
royal commanders, be in readiness: <END>
for with a band of thirty thousand men <END>
comes warwick, backing of the duke of york; <END>
and in the towns, as they do march along, <END>
proclaims him king, and many fly to him: <END>
darraign your battle, for they are at hand. <END>
i would your highness would depart the field: <END>
the queen hath best success when you are absent. <END>
ay, good my lord, and leave us to our fortune. <END>
why, that's my fortune too; therefore i'll stay. <END>
be it with resolution then to fight. <END>
my royal father, cheer these noble lords <END>
and hearten those that fight in your defence: <END>
unsheathe your sword, good father; cry 'saint george!' <END>
now, perjured henry! wilt thou kneel for grace, <END>
and set thy diadem upon my head; <END>
or bide the mortal fortune of the field? <END>
go, rate thy minions, proud insulting boy! <END>
becomes it thee to be thus bold in terms <END>
before thy sovereign and thy lawful king? <END>
i am his king, and he should bow his knee; <END>
i was adopted heir by his consent: <END>
since when, his oath is broke; for, as i hear, <END>
you, that are king, though he do wear the crown, <END>
have caused him, by new act of parliament, <END>
to blot out me, and put his own son in. <END>
and reason too: <END>
who should succeed the father but the son? <END>
are you there, butcher? o, i cannot speak! <END>
ay, crook-back, here i stand to answer thee, <END>
or any he the proudest of thy sort. <END>
'twas you that kill'd young rutland, was it not? <END>
ay, and old york, and yet not satisfied. <END>
for god's sake, lords, give signal to the fight. <END>
what say'st thou, henry, wilt thou yield the crown? <END>
why, how now, long-tongued warwick! dare you speak? <END>
when you and i met at saint alban's last, <END>
your legs did better service than your hands. <END>
then 'twas my turn to fly, and now 'tis thine. <END>
you said so much before, and yet you fled. <END>
'twas not your valour, clifford, drove me thence. <END>
no, nor your manhood that durst make you stay. <END>
northumberland, i hold thee reverently. <END>
break off the parley; for scarce i can refrain <END>
the execution of my big-swoln heart <END>
upon that clifford, that cruel child-killer. <END>
i slew thy father, call'st thou him a child? <END>
ay, like a dastard and a treacherous coward, <END>
as thou didst kill our tender brother rutland; <END>
but ere sunset i'll make thee curse the deed. <END>
have done with words, my lords, and hear me speak. <END>
defy them then, or else hold close thy lips. <END>
i prithee, give no limits to my tongue: <END>
i am a king, and privileged to speak. <END>
my liege, the wound that bred this meeting here <END>
cannot be cured by words; therefore be still. <END>
then, executioner, unsheathe thy sword: <END>
by him that made us all, i am resolved <END>
that clifford's manhood lies upon his tongue. <END>
say, henry, shall i have my right, or no? <END>
a thousand men have broke their fasts to-day, <END>
that ne'er shall dine unless thou yield the crown. <END>
if thou deny, their blood upon thy head; <END>
for york in justice puts his armour on. <END>
if that be right which warwick says is right, <END>
there is no wrong, but every thing is right. <END>
whoever got thee, there thy mother stands; <END>
for, well i wot, thou hast thy mother's tongue. <END>
but thou art neither like thy sire nor dam; <END>
but like a foul mis-shapen stigmatic, <END>
mark'd by the destinies to be avoided, <END>
as venom toads, or lizards' dreadful stings. <END>
iron of naples hid with english gilt, <END>
whose father bears the title of a king,-- <END>
as if a channel should be call'd the sea,-- <END>
shamest thou not, knowing whence thou art extraught, <END>
to let thy tongue detect thy base-born heart? <END>
a wisp of straw were worth a thousand crowns, <END>
to make this shameless callet know herself. <END>
helen of greece was fairer far than thou, <END>
although thy husband may be menelaus; <END>
and ne'er was agamemnon's brother wrong'd <END>
by that false woman, as this king by thee. <END>
his father revell'd in the heart of france, <END>
and tamed the king, and made the dauphin stoop; <END>
and had he match'd according to his state, <END>
he might have kept that glory to this day; <END>
but when he took a beggar to his bed, <END>
and graced thy poor sire with his bridal-day, <END>
even then that sunshine brew'd a shower for him, <END>
that wash'd his father's fortunes forth of france, <END>
and heap'd sedition on his crown at home. <END>
for what hath broach'd this tumult but thy pride? <END>
hadst thou been meek, our title still had slept; <END>
and we, in pity of the gentle king, <END>
had slipp'd our claim until another age. <END>
but when we saw our sunshine made thy spring, <END>
and that thy summer bred us no increase, <END>
we set the axe to thy usurping root; <END>
and though the edge hath something hit ourselves, <END>
yet, know thou, since we have begun to strike, <END>
we'll never leave till we have hewn thee down, <END>
or bathed thy growing with our heated bloods. <END>
and, in this resolution, i defy thee; <END>
not willing any longer conference, <END>
since thou deniest the gentle king to speak. <END>
sound trumpets! let our bloody colours wave! <END>
and either victory, or else a grave. <END>
stay, edward. <END>
no, wrangling woman, we'll no longer stay: <END>
these words will cost ten thousand lives this day. <END>
3 king henry vi <END>
forspent with toil, as runners with a race, <END>
i lay me down a little while to breathe; <END>
for strokes received, and many blows repaid, <END>
have robb'd my strong-knit sinews of their strength, <END>
and spite of spite needs must i rest awhile. <END>
smile, gentle heaven! or strike, ungentle death! <END>
for this world frowns, and edward's sun is clouded. <END>
how now, my lord! what hap? what hope of good? <END>
our hap is loss, our hope but sad despair; <END>
our ranks are broke, and ruin follows us: <END>
what counsel give you? whither shall we fly? <END>
bootless is flight, they follow us with wings; <END>
and weak we are and cannot shun pursuit. <END>
ah, warwick, why hast thou withdrawn thyself? <END>
thy brother's blood the thirsty earth hath drunk, <END>
broach'd with the steely point of clifford's lance; <END>
and in the very pangs of death he cried, <END>
like to a dismal clangour heard from far, <END>
'warwick, revenge! brother, revenge my death!' <END>
so, underneath the belly of their steeds, <END>
that stain'd their fetlocks in his smoking blood, <END>
the noble gentleman gave up the ghost. <END>
then let the earth be drunken with our blood: <END>
i'll kill my horse, because i will not fly. <END>
why stand we like soft-hearted women here, <END>
wailing our losses, whiles the foe doth rage; <END>
and look upon, as if the tragedy <END>
were play'd in jest by counterfeiting actors? <END>
here on my knee i vow to god above, <END>
i'll never pause again, never stand still, <END>
till either death hath closed these eyes of mine <END>
or fortune given me measure of revenge. <END>
o warwick, i do bend my knee with thine; <END>
and in this vow do chain my soul to thine! <END>
and, ere my knee rise from the earth's cold face, <END>
i throw my hands, mine eyes, my heart to thee, <END>
thou setter up and plucker down of kings, <END>
beseeching thee, if with they will it stands <END>
that to my foes this body must be prey, <END>
yet that thy brazen gates of heaven may ope, <END>
and give sweet passage to my sinful soul! <END>
now, lords, take leave until we meet again, <END>
where'er it be, in heaven or in earth. <END>
brother, give me thy hand; and, gentle warwick, <END>
let me embrace thee in my weary arms: <END>
i, that did never weep, now melt with woe <END>
that winter should cut off our spring-time so. <END>
away, away! once more, sweet lords farewell. <END>
yet let us all together to our troops, <END>
and give them leave to fly that will not stay; <END>
and call them pillars that will stand to us; <END>
and, if we thrive, promise them such rewards <END>
as victors wear at the olympian games: <END>
this may plant courage in their quailing breasts; <END>
for yet is hope of life and victory. <END>
forslow no longer, make we hence amain. <END>
3 king henry vi <END>
now, clifford, i have singled thee alone: <END>
suppose this arm is for the duke of york, <END>
and this for rutland; both bound to revenge, <END>
wert thou environ'd with a brazen wall. <END>
now, richard, i am with thee here alone: <END>
this is the hand that stabb'd thy father york; <END>
and this the hand that slew thy brother rutland; <END>
and here's the heart that triumphs in their death <END>
and cheers these hands that slew thy sire and brother <END>
to execute the like upon thyself; <END>
and so, have at thee! <END>
nay warwick, single out some other chase; <END>
for i myself will hunt this wolf to death. <END>
3 king henry vi <END>
this battle fares like to the morning's war, <END>
when dying clouds contend with growing light, <END>
what time the shepherd, blowing of his nails, <END>
can neither call it perfect day nor night. <END>
now sways it this way, like a mighty sea <END>
forced by the tide to combat with the wind; <END>
now sways it that way, like the selfsame sea <END>
forced to retire by fury of the wind: <END>
sometime the flood prevails, and then the wind; <END>
now one the better, then another best; <END>
both tugging to be victors, breast to breast, <END>
yet neither conqueror nor conquered: <END>
so is the equal of this fell war. <END>
here on this molehill will i sit me down. <END>
to whom god will, there be the victory! <END>
for margaret my queen, and clifford too, <END>
have chid me from the battle; swearing both <END>
they prosper best of all when i am thence. <END>
would i were dead! if god's good will were so; <END>
for what is in this world but grief and woe? <END>
o god! methinks it were a happy life, <END>
to be no better than a homely swain; <END>
to sit upon a hill, as i do now, <END>
to carve out dials quaintly, point by point, <END>
thereby to see the minutes how they run, <END>
how many make the hour full complete; <END>
how many hours bring about the day; <END>
how many days will finish up the year; <END>
how many years a mortal man may live. <END>
when this is known, then to divide the times: <END>
so many hours must i tend my flock; <END>
so many hours must i take my rest; <END>
so many hours must i contemplate; <END>
so many hours must i sport myself; <END>
so many days my ewes have been with young; <END>
so many weeks ere the poor fools will ean: <END>
so many years ere i shall shear the fleece: <END>
so minutes, hours, days, months, and years, <END>
pass'd over to the end they were created, <END>
would bring white hairs unto a quiet grave. <END>
ah, what a life were this! how sweet! how lovely! <END>
gives not the hawthorn-bush a sweeter shade <END>
to shepherds looking on their silly sheep, <END>
than doth a rich embroider'd canopy <END>
to kings that fear their subjects' treachery? <END>
o, yes, it doth; a thousand-fold it doth. <END>
and to conclude, the shepherd's homely curds, <END>
his cold thin drink out of his leather bottle. <END>
his wonted sleep under a fresh tree's shade, <END>
all which secure and sweetly he enjoys, <END>
is far beyond a prince's delicates, <END>
his viands sparkling in a golden cup, <END>
his body couched in a curious bed, <END>
when care, mistrust, and treason waits on him. <END>
ill blows the wind that profits nobody. <END>
this man, whom hand to hand i slew in fight, <END>
may be possessed with some store of crowns; <END>
and i, that haply take them from him now, <END>
may yet ere night yield both my life and them <END>
to some man else, as this dead man doth me. <END>
who's this? o god! it is my father's face, <END>
whom in this conflict i unwares have kill'd. <END>
o heavy times, begetting such events! <END>
from london by the king was i press'd forth; <END>
my father, being the earl of warwick's man, <END>
came on the part of york, press'd by his master; <END>
and i, who at his hands received my life, him <END>
have by my hands of life bereaved him. <END>
pardon me, god, i knew not what i did! <END>
and pardon, father, for i knew not thee! <END>
my tears shall wipe away these bloody marks; <END>
and no more words till they have flow'd their fill. <END>
o piteous spectacle! o bloody times! <END>
whiles lions war and battle for their dens, <END>
poor harmless lambs abide their enmity. <END>
weep, wretched man, i'll aid thee tear for tear; <END>
and let our hearts and eyes, like civil war, <END>
be blind with tears, and break o'ercharged with grief. <END>
thou that so stoutly hast resisted me, <END>
give me thy gold, if thou hast any gold: <END>
for i have bought it with an hundred blows. <END>
but let me see: is this our foeman's face? <END>
ah, no, no, no, it is mine only son! <END>
ah, boy, if any life be left in thee, <END>
throw up thine eye! see, see what showers arise, <END>
blown with the windy tempest of my heart, <END>
upon thy words, that kill mine eye and heart! <END>
o, pity, god, this miserable age! <END>
what stratagems, how fell, how butcherly, <END>
erroneous, mutinous and unnatural, <END>
this deadly quarrel daily doth beget! <END>
o boy, thy father gave thee life too soon, <END>
and hath bereft thee of thy life too late! <END>
woe above woe! grief more than common grief! <END>
o that my death would stay these ruthful deeds! <END>
o pity, pity, gentle heaven, pity! <END>
the red rose and the white are on his face, <END>
the fatal colours of our striving houses: <END>
the one his purple blood right well resembles; <END>
the other his pale cheeks, methinks, presenteth: <END>
wither one rose, and let the other flourish; <END>
if you contend, a thousand lives must wither. <END>
how will my mother for a father's death <END>
take on with me and ne'er be satisfied! <END>
how will my wife for slaughter of my son <END>
shed seas of tears and ne'er be satisfied! <END>
how will the country for these woful chances <END>
misthink the king and not be satisfied! <END>
was ever son so rued a father's death? <END>
was ever father so bemoan'd his son? <END>
was ever king so grieved for subjects' woe? <END>
much is your sorrow; mine ten times so much. <END>
i'll bear thee hence, where i may weep my fill. <END>
these arms of mine shall be thy winding-sheet; <END>
my heart, sweet boy, shall be thy sepulchre, <END>
for from my heart thine image ne'er shall go; <END>
my sighing breast shall be thy funeral bell; <END>
and so obsequious will thy father be, <END>
even for the loss of thee, having no more, <END>
as priam was for all his valiant sons. <END>
i'll bear thee hence; and let them fight that will, <END>
for i have murdered where i should not kill. <END>
sad-hearted men, much overgone with care, <END>
here sits a king more woful than you are. <END>
fly, father, fly! for all your friends are fled, <END>
and warwick rages like a chafed bull: <END>
away! for death doth hold us in pursuit. <END>
mount you, my lord; towards berwick post amain: <END>
edward and richard, like a brace of greyhounds <END>
having the fearful flying hare in sight, <END>
with fiery eyes sparkling for very wrath, <END>
and bloody steel grasp'd in their ireful hands, <END>
are at our backs; and therefore hence amain. <END>
away! for vengeance comes along with them: <END>
nay, stay not to expostulate, make speed; <END>
or else come after: i'll away before. <END>
nay, take me with thee, good sweet exeter: <END>
not that i fear to stay, but love to go <END>
whither the queen intends. forward; away! <END>
3 king henry vi <END>
here burns my candle out; ay, here it dies, <END>
which, whiles it lasted, gave king henry light. <END>
o lancaster, i fear thy overthrow <END>
more than my body's parting with my soul! <END>
my love and fear glued many friends to thee; <END>
and, now i fall, thy tough commixture melts. <END>
impairing henry, strengthening misproud york, <END>
the common people swarm like summer flies; <END>
and whither fly the gnats but to the sun? <END>
and who shines now but henry's enemies? <END>
o phoebus, hadst thou never given consent <END>
that phaethon should cheque thy fiery steeds, <END>
thy burning car never had scorch'd the earth! <END>
and, henry, hadst thou sway'd as kings should do, <END>
or as thy father and his father did, <END>
giving no ground unto the house of york, <END>
they never then had sprung like summer flies; <END>
i and ten thousand in this luckless realm <END>
had left no mourning widows for our death; <END>
and thou this day hadst kept thy chair in peace. <END>
for what doth cherish weeds but gentle air? <END>
and what makes robbers bold but too much lenity? <END>
bootless are plaints, and cureless are my wounds; <END>
no way to fly, nor strength to hold out flight: <END>
the foe is merciless, and will not pity; <END>
for at their hands i have deserved no pity. <END>
the air hath got into my deadly wounds, <END>
and much effuse of blood doth make me faint. <END>
come, york and richard, warwick and the rest; <END>
i stabb'd your fathers' bosoms, split my breast. <END>
now breathe we, lords: good fortune bids us pause, <END>
and smooth the frowns of war with peaceful looks. <END>
some troops pursue the bloody-minded queen, <END>
that led calm henry, though he were a king, <END>
as doth a sail, fill'd with a fretting gust, <END>
command an argosy to stem the waves. <END>
but think you, lords, that clifford fled with them? <END>
no, 'tis impossible he should escape, <END>
for, though before his face i speak the words <END>
your brother richard mark'd him for the grave: <END>
and wheresoe'er he is, he's surely dead. <END>
whose soul is that which takes her heavy leave? <END>
a deadly groan, like life and death's departing. <END>
see who it is: and, now the battle's ended, <END>
if friend or foe, let him be gently used. <END>
revoke that doom of mercy, for 'tis clifford; <END>
who not contented that he lopp'd the branch <END>
in hewing rutland when his leaves put forth, <END>
but set his murdering knife unto the root <END>
from whence that tender spray did sweetly spring, <END>
i mean our princely father, duke of york. <END>
from off the gates of york fetch down the head, <END>
your father's head, which clifford placed there; <END>
instead whereof let this supply the room: <END>
measure for measure must be answered. <END>
bring forth that fatal screech-owl to our house, <END>
that nothing sung but death to us and ours: <END>
now death shall stop his dismal threatening sound, <END>
and his ill-boding tongue no more shall speak. <END>
i think his understanding is bereft. <END>
speak, clifford, dost thou know who speaks to thee? <END>
dark cloudy death o'ershades his beams of life, <END>
and he nor sees nor hears us what we say. <END>
o, would he did! and so perhaps he doth: <END>
'tis but his policy to counterfeit, <END>
because he would avoid such bitter taunts <END>
which in the time of death he gave our father. <END>
if so thou think'st, vex him with eager words. <END>
clifford, ask mercy and obtain no grace. <END>
clifford, repent in bootless penitence. <END>
clifford, devise excuses for thy faults. <END>
while we devise fell tortures for thy faults. <END>
thou didst love york, and i am son to york. <END>
thou pitied'st rutland; i will pity thee. <END>
where's captain margaret, to fence you now? <END>
they mock thee, clifford: swear as thou wast wont. <END>
what, not an oath? nay, then the world goes hard <END>
when clifford cannot spare his friends an oath. <END>
i know by that he's dead; and, by my soul, <END>
if this right hand would buy two hour's life, <END>
that i in all despite might rail at him, <END>
this hand should chop it off, and with the <END>
issuing blood <END>
stifle the villain whose unstanched thirst <END>
york and young rutland could not satisfy. <END>
ay, but he's dead: off with the traitor's head, <END>
and rear it in the place your father's stands. <END>
and now to london with triumphant march, <END>
there to be crowned england's royal king: <END>
from whence shall warwick cut the sea to france, <END>
and ask the lady bona for thy queen: <END>
so shalt thou sinew both these lands together; <END>
and, having france thy friend, thou shalt not dread <END>
the scatter'd foe that hopes to rise again; <END>
for though they cannot greatly sting to hurt, <END>
yet look to have them buzz to offend thine ears. <END>
first will i see the coronation; <END>
and then to brittany i'll cross the sea, <END>
to effect this marriage, so it please my lord. <END>
even as thou wilt, sweet warwick, let it be; <END>
for in thy shoulder do i build my seat, <END>
and never will i undertake the thing <END>
wherein thy counsel and consent is wanting. <END>
richard, i will create thee duke of gloucester, <END>
and george, of clarence: warwick, as ourself, <END>
shall do and undo as him pleaseth best. <END>
let me be duke of clarence, george of gloucester; <END>
for gloucester's dukedom is too ominous. <END>
tut, that's a foolish observation: <END>
richard, be duke of gloucester. now to london, <END>
to see these honours in possession. <END>
3 king henry vi <END>
under this thick-grown brake we'll shroud ourselves; <END>
for through this laund anon the deer will come; <END>
and in this covert will we make our stand, <END>
culling the principal of all the deer. <END>
i'll stay above the hill, so both may shoot. <END>
that cannot be; the noise of thy cross-bow <END>
will scare the herd, and so my shoot is lost. <END>
here stand we both, and aim we at the best: <END>
and, for the time shall not seem tedious, <END>
i'll tell thee what befell me on a day <END>
in this self-place where now we mean to stand. <END>
here comes a man; let's stay till he be past. <END>
from scotland am i stol'n, even of pure love, <END>
to greet mine own land with my wishful sight. <END>
no, harry, harry, 'tis no land of thine; <END>
thy place is fill'd, thy sceptre wrung from thee, <END>
thy balm wash'd off wherewith thou wast anointed: <END>
no bending knee will call thee caesar now, <END>
no humble suitors press to speak for right, <END>
no, not a man comes for redress of thee; <END>
for how can i help them, and not myself? <END>
ay, here's a deer whose skin's a keeper's fee: <END>
this is the quondam king; let's seize upon him. <END>
let me embrace thee, sour adversity, <END>
for wise men say it is the wisest course. <END>
why linger we? let us lay hands upon him. <END>
forbear awhile; we'll hear a little more. <END>
my queen and son are gone to france for aid; <END>
and, as i hear, the great commanding warwick <END>
is thither gone, to crave the french king's sister <END>
to wife for edward: if this news be true, <END>
poor queen and son, your labour is but lost; <END>
for warwick is a subtle orator, <END>
and lewis a prince soon won with moving words. <END>
by this account then margaret may win him; <END>
for she's a woman to be pitied much: <END>
her sighs will make a battery in his breast; <END>
her tears will pierce into a marble heart; <END>
the tiger will be mild whiles she doth mourn; <END>
and nero will be tainted with remorse, <END>
to hear and see her plaints, her brinish tears. <END>
ay, but she's come to beg, warwick to give; <END>
she, on his left side, craving aid for henry, <END>
he, on his right, asking a wife for edward. <END>
she weeps, and says her henry is deposed; <END>
he smiles, and says his edward is install'd; <END>
that she, poor wretch, for grief can speak no more; <END>
whiles warwick tells his title, smooths the wrong, <END>
inferreth arguments of mighty strength, <END>
and in conclusion wins the king from her, <END>
with promise of his sister, and what else, <END>
to strengthen and support king edward's place. <END>
o margaret, thus 'twill be; and thou, poor soul, <END>
art then forsaken, as thou went'st forlorn! <END>
say, what art thou that talk'st of kings and queens? <END>
more than i seem, and less than i was born to: <END>
a man at least, for less i should not be; <END>
and men may talk of kings, and why not i? <END>
ay, but thou talk'st as if thou wert a king. <END>
why, so i am, in mind; and that's enough. <END>
but, if thou be a king, where is thy crown? <END>
my crown is in my heart, not on my head; <END>
not decked with diamonds and indian stones, <END>
nor to be seen: my crown is called content: <END>
a crown it is that seldom kings enjoy. <END>
well, if you be a king crown'd with content, <END>
your crown content and you must be contented <END>
to go along with us; for as we think, <END>
you are the king king edward hath deposed; <END>
and we his subjects sworn in all allegiance <END>
will apprehend you as his enemy. <END>
but did you never swear, and break an oath? <END>
no, never such an oath; nor will not now. <END>
where did you dwell when i was king of england? <END>
here in this country, where we now remain. <END>
i was anointed king at nine months old; <END>
my father and my grandfather were kings, <END>
and you were sworn true subjects unto me: <END>
and tell me, then, have you not broke your oaths? <END>
no; <END>
for we were subjects but while you were king. <END>
why, am i dead? do i not breathe a man? <END>
ah, simple men, you know not what you swear! <END>
look, as i blow this feather from my face, <END>
and as the air blows it to me again, <END>
obeying with my wind when i do blow, <END>
and yielding to another when it blows, <END>
commanded always by the greater gust; <END>
such is the lightness of you common men. <END>
but do not break your oaths; for of that sin <END>
my mild entreaty shall not make you guilty. <END>
go where you will, the king shall be commanded; <END>
and be you kings, command, and i'll obey. <END>
we are true subjects to the king, king edward. <END>
so would you be again to henry, <END>
if he were seated as king edward is. <END>
we charge you, in god's name, and the king's, <END>
to go with us unto the officers. <END>
in god's name, lead; your king's name be obey'd: <END>
and what god will, that let your king perform; <END>
and what he will, i humbly yield unto. <END>
3 king henry vi <END>
brother of gloucester, at saint alban's field <END>
this lady's husband, sir richard grey, was slain, <END>
his lands then seized on by the conqueror: <END>
her suit is now to repossess those lands; <END>
which we in justice cannot well deny, <END>
because in quarrel of the house of york <END>
the worthy gentleman did lose his life. <END>
your highness shall do well to grant her suit; <END>
it were dishonour to deny it her. <END>
it were no less; but yet i'll make a pause. <END>
widow, we will consider of your suit; <END>
and come some other time to know our mind. <END>
right gracious lord, i cannot brook delay: <END>
may it please your highness to resolve me now; <END>
and what your pleasure is, shall satisfy me. <END>
how many children hast thou, widow? tell me. <END>
three, my most gracious lord. <END>
'twere pity they should lose their father's lands. <END>
be pitiful, dread lord, and grant it then. <END>
lords, give us leave: i'll try this widow's wit. <END>
now tell me, madam, do you love your children? <END>
ay, full as dearly as i love myself. <END>
and would you not do much to do them good? <END>
to do them good, i would sustain some harm. <END>
then get your husband's lands, to do them good. <END>
therefore i came unto your majesty. <END>
i'll tell you how these lands are to be got. <END>
so shall you bind me to your highness' service. <END>
what service wilt thou do me, if i give them? <END>
what you command, that rests in me to do. <END>
but you will take exceptions to my boon. <END>
no, gracious lord, except i cannot do it. <END>
ay, but thou canst do what i mean to ask. <END>
why, then i will do what your grace commands. <END>
why stops my lord, shall i not hear my task? <END>
an easy task; 'tis but to love a king. <END>
that's soon perform'd, because i am a subject. <END>
why, then, thy husband's lands i freely give thee. <END>
i take my leave with many thousand thanks. <END>
but stay thee, 'tis the fruits of love i mean. <END>
the fruits of love i mean, my loving liege. <END>
ay, but, i fear me, in another sense. <END>
what love, think'st thou, i sue so much to get? <END>
my love till death, my humble thanks, my prayers; <END>
that love which virtue begs and virtue grants. <END>
no, by my troth, i did not mean such love. <END>
why, then you mean not as i thought you did. <END>
but now you partly may perceive my mind. <END>
my mind will never grant what i perceive <END>
your highness aims at, if i aim aright. <END>
to tell thee plain, i aim to lie with thee. <END>
to tell you plain, i had rather lie in prison. <END>
why, then thou shalt not have thy husband's lands. <END>
why, then mine honesty shall be my dower; <END>
for by that loss i will not purchase them. <END>
therein thou wrong'st thy children mightily. <END>
herein your highness wrongs both them and me. <END>
but, mighty lord, this merry inclination <END>
accords not with the sadness of my suit: <END>
please you dismiss me either with 'ay' or 'no.' <END>
ay, if thou wilt say 'ay' to my request; <END>
no if thou dost say 'no' to my demand. <END>
then, no, my lord. my suit is at an end. <END>
'tis better said than done, my gracious lord: <END>
i am a subject fit to jest withal, <END>
but far unfit to be a sovereign. <END>
sweet widow, by my state i swear to thee <END>
i speak no more than what my soul intends; <END>
and that is, to enjoy thee for my love. <END>
and that is more than i will yield unto: <END>
i know i am too mean to be your queen, <END>
and yet too good to be your concubine. <END>
you cavil, widow: i did mean, my queen. <END>
'twill grieve your grace my sons should call you father. <END>
no more than when my daughters call thee mother. <END>
thou art a widow, and thou hast some children; <END>
and, by god's mother, i, being but a bachelor, <END>
have other some: why, 'tis a happy thing <END>
to be the father unto many sons. <END>
answer no more, for thou shalt be my queen. <END>
brothers, you muse what chat we two have had. <END>
the widow likes it not, for she looks very sad. <END>
you'll think it strange if i should marry her. <END>
to whom, my lord? <END>
why, clarence, to myself. <END>
that would be ten days' wonder at the least. <END>
that's a day longer than a wonder lasts. <END>
by so much is the wonder in extremes. <END>
well, jest on, brothers: i can tell you both <END>
her suit is granted for her husband's lands. <END>
my gracious lord, henry your foe is taken, <END>
and brought your prisoner to your palace gate. <END>
see that he be convey'd unto the tower: <END>
and go we, brothers, to the man that took him, <END>
to question of his apprehension. <END>
widow, go you along. lords, use her honourably. <END>
ay, edward will use women honourably. <END>
would he were wasted, marrow, bones and all, <END>
that from his loins no hopeful branch may spring, <END>
to cross me from the golden time i look for! <END>
and yet, between my soul's desire and me-- <END>
the lustful edward's title buried-- <END>
is clarence, henry, and his son young edward, <END>
and all the unlook'd for issue of their bodies, <END>
to take their rooms, ere i can place myself: <END>
a cold premeditation for my purpose! <END>
why, then, i do but dream on sovereignty; <END>
like one that stands upon a promontory, <END>
and spies a far-off shore where he would tread, <END>
wishing his foot were equal with his eye, <END>
and chides the sea that sunders him from thence, <END>
saying, he'll lade it dry to have his way: <END>
so do i wish the crown, being so far off; <END>
and so i chide the means that keeps me from it; <END>
and so i say, i'll cut the causes off, <END>
flattering me with impossibilities. <END>
my eye's too quick, my heart o'erweens too much, <END>
unless my hand and strength could equal them. <END>
well, say there is no kingdom then for richard; <END>
what other pleasure can the world afford? <END>
i'll make my heaven in a lady's lap, <END>
and deck my body in gay ornaments, <END>
and witch sweet ladies with my words and looks. <END>
o miserable thought! and more unlikely <END>
than to accomplish twenty golden crowns! <END>
why, love forswore me in my mother's womb: <END>
and, for i should not deal in her soft laws, <END>
she did corrupt frail nature with some bribe, <END>
to shrink mine arm up like a wither'd shrub; <END>
to make an envious mountain on my back, <END>
where sits deformity to mock my body; <END>
to shape my legs of an unequal size; <END>
to disproportion me in every part, <END>
like to a chaos, or an unlick'd bear-whelp <END>
that carries no impression like the dam. <END>
and am i then a man to be beloved? <END>
o monstrous fault, to harbour such a thought! <END>
then, since this earth affords no joy to me, <END>
but to command, to cheque, to o'erbear such <END>
as are of better person than myself, <END>
i'll make my heaven to dream upon the crown, <END>
and, whiles i live, to account this world but hell, <END>
until my mis-shaped trunk that bears this head <END>
be round impaled with a glorious crown. <END>
and yet i know not how to get the crown, <END>
for many lives stand between me and home: <END>
and i,--like one lost in a thorny wood, <END>
that rends the thorns and is rent with the thorns, <END>
seeking a way and straying from the way; <END>
not knowing how to find the open air, <END>
but toiling desperately to find it out,-- <END>
torment myself to catch the english crown: <END>
and from that torment i will free myself, <END>
or hew my way out with a bloody axe. <END>
why, i can smile, and murder whiles i smile, <END>
and cry 'content' to that which grieves my heart, <END>
and wet my cheeks with artificial tears, <END>
and frame my face to all occasions. <END>
i'll drown more sailors than the mermaid shall; <END>
i'll slay more gazers than the basilisk; <END>
i'll play the orator as well as nestor, <END>
deceive more slily than ulysses could, <END>
and, like a sinon, take another troy. <END>
i can add colours to the chameleon, <END>
change shapes with proteus for advantages, <END>
and set the murderous machiavel to school. <END>
can i do this, and cannot get a crown? <END>
tut, were it farther off, i'll pluck it down. <END>
3 king henry vi <END>
fair queen of england, worthy margaret, <END>
sit down with us: it ill befits thy state <END>
and birth, that thou shouldst stand while lewis doth sit. <END>
no, mighty king of france: now margaret <END>
must strike her sail and learn awhile to serve <END>
where kings command. i was, i must confess, <END>
great albion's queen in former golden days: <END>
but now mischance hath trod my title down, <END>
and with dishonour laid me on the ground; <END>
where i must take like seat unto my fortune, <END>
and to my humble seat conform myself. <END>
why, say, fair queen, whence springs this deep despair? <END>
from such a cause as fills mine eyes with tears <END>
and stops my tongue, while heart is drown'd in cares. <END>
whate'er it be, be thou still like thyself, <END>
and sit thee by our side: <END>
yield not thy neck <END>
to fortune's yoke, but let thy dauntless mind <END>
still ride in triumph over all mischance. <END>
be plain, queen margaret, and tell thy grief; <END>
it shall be eased, if france can yield relief. <END>
those gracious words revive my drooping thoughts <END>
and give my tongue-tied sorrows leave to speak. <END>
now, therefore, be it known to noble lewis, <END>
that henry, sole possessor of my love, <END>
is of a king become a banish'd man, <END>
and forced to live in scotland a forlorn; <END>
while proud ambitious edward duke of york <END>
usurps the regal title and the seat <END>
of england's true-anointed lawful king. <END>
this is the cause that i, poor margaret, <END>
with this my son, prince edward, henry's heir, <END>
am come to crave thy just and lawful aid; <END>
and if thou fail us, all our hope is done: <END>
scotland hath will to help, but cannot help; <END>
our people and our peers are both misled, <END>
our treasures seized, our soldiers put to flight, <END>
and, as thou seest, ourselves in heavy plight. <END>
renowned queen, with patience calm the storm, <END>
while we bethink a means to break it off. <END>
the more we stay, the stronger grows our foe. <END>
the more i stay, the more i'll succor thee. <END>
o, but impatience waiteth on true sorrow. <END>
and see where comes the breeder of my sorrow! <END>
what's he approacheth boldly to our presence? <END>
our earl of warwick, edward's greatest friend. <END>
welcome, brave warwick! what brings thee to france? <END>
ay, now begins a second storm to rise; <END>
for this is he that moves both wind and tide. <END>
from worthy edward, king of albion, <END>
my lord and sovereign, and thy vowed friend, <END>
i come, in kindness and unfeigned love, <END>
first, to do greetings to thy royal person; <END>
and then to crave a league of amity; <END>
and lastly, to confirm that amity <END>
with a nuptial knot, if thou vouchsafe to grant <END>
that virtuous lady bona, thy fair sister, <END>
to england's king in lawful marriage. <END>
king lewis and lady bona, hear me speak, <END>
before you answer warwick. his demand <END>
springs not from edward's well-meant honest love, <END>
but from deceit bred by necessity; <END>
for how can tyrants safely govern home, <END>
unless abroad they purchase great alliance? <END>
to prove him tyrant this reason may suffice, <END>
that henry liveth still: but were he dead, <END>
yet here prince edward stands, king henry's son. <END>
look, therefore, lewis, that by this league and marriage <END>
thou draw not on thy danger and dishonour; <END>
for though usurpers sway the rule awhile, <END>
yet heavens are just, and time suppresseth wrongs. <END>
injurious margaret! <END>
and why not queen? <END>
because thy father henry did usurp; <END>
and thou no more are prince than she is queen. <END>
then warwick disannuls great john of gaunt, <END>
which did subdue the greatest part of spain; <END>
and, after john of gaunt, henry the fourth, <END>
whose wisdom was a mirror to the wisest; <END>
and, after that wise prince, henry the fifth, <END>
who by his prowess conquered all france: <END>
from these our henry lineally descends. <END>
oxford, how haps it, in this smooth discourse, <END>
you told not how henry the sixth hath lost <END>
all that which henry fifth had gotten? <END>
methinks these peers of france should smile at that. <END>
but for the rest, you tell a pedigree <END>
of threescore and two years; a silly time <END>
to make prescription for a kingdom's worth. <END>
why, warwick, canst thou speak against thy liege, <END>
whom thou obeyed'st thirty and six years, <END>
and not bewray thy treason with a blush? <END>
can oxford, that did ever fence the right, <END>
now buckler falsehood with a pedigree? <END>
for shame! leave henry, and call edward king. <END>
call him my king by whose injurious doom <END>
my elder brother, the lord aubrey vere, <END>
was done to death? and more than so, my father, <END>
even in the downfall of his mellow'd years, <END>
when nature brought him to the door of death? <END>
no, warwick, no; while life upholds this arm, <END>
this arm upholds the house of lancaster. <END>
and i the house of york. <END>
queen margaret, prince edward, and oxford, <END>
vouchsafe, at our request, to stand aside, <END>
while i use further conference with warwick. <END>
heavens grant that warwick's words bewitch him not! <END>
now warwick, tell me, even upon thy conscience, <END>
is edward your true king? for i were loath <END>
to link with him that were not lawful chosen. <END>
thereon i pawn my credit and mine honour. <END>
but is he gracious in the people's eye? <END>
the more that henry was unfortunate. <END>
then further, all dissembling set aside, <END>
tell me for truth the measure of his love <END>
unto our sister bona. <END>
such it seems <END>
as may beseem a monarch like himself. <END>
myself have often heard him say and swear <END>
that this his love was an eternal plant, <END>
whereof the root was fix'd in virtue's ground, <END>
the leaves and fruit maintain'd with beauty's sun, <END>
exempt from envy, but not from disdain, <END>
unless the lady bona quit his pain. <END>
now, sister, let us hear your firm resolve. <END>
your grant, or your denial, shall be mine: <END>
yet i confess that often ere this day, <END>
when i have heard your king's desert recounted, <END>
mine ear hath tempted judgment to desire. <END>
then, warwick, thus: our sister shall be edward's; <END>
and now forthwith shall articles be drawn <END>
touching the jointure that your king must make, <END>
which with her dowry shall be counterpoised. <END>
draw near, queen margaret, and be a witness <END>
that bona shall be wife to the english king. <END>
to edward, but not to the english king. <END>
deceitful warwick! it was thy device <END>
by this alliance to make void my suit: <END>
before thy coming lewis was henry's friend. <END>
and still is friend to him and margaret: <END>
but if your title to the crown be weak, <END>
as may appear by edward's good success, <END>
then 'tis but reason that i be released <END>
from giving aid which late i promised. <END>
yet shall you have all kindness at my hand <END>
that your estate requires and mine can yield. <END>
henry now lives in scotland at his ease, <END>
where having nothing, nothing can he lose. <END>
and as for you yourself, our quondam queen, <END>
you have a father able to maintain you; <END>
and better 'twere you troubled him than france. <END>
peace, impudent and shameless warwick, peace, <END>
proud setter up and puller down of kings! <END>
i will not hence, till, with my talk and tears, <END>
both full of truth, i make king lewis behold <END>
thy sly conveyance and thy lord's false love; <END>
for both of you are birds of selfsame feather. <END>
warwick, this is some post to us or thee. <END>
i like it well that our fair queen and mistress <END>
smiles at her news, while warwick frowns at his. <END>
nay, mark how lewis stamps, as he were nettled: <END>
i hope all's for the best. <END>
warwick, what are thy news? and yours, fair queen? <END>
mine, such as fill my heart with unhoped joys. <END>
mine, full of sorrow and heart's discontent. <END>
what! has your king married the lady grey! <END>
and now, to soothe your forgery and his, <END>
sends me a paper to persuade me patience? <END>
is this the alliance that he seeks with france? <END>
dare he presume to scorn us in this manner? <END>
i told your majesty as much before: <END>
this proveth edward's love and warwick's honesty. <END>
king lewis, i here protest, in sight of heaven, <END>
and by the hope i have of heavenly bliss, <END>
that i am clear from this misdeed of edward's, <END>
no more my king, for he dishonours me, <END>
but most himself, if he could see his shame. <END>
did i forget that by the house of york <END>
my father came untimely to his death? <END>
did i let pass the abuse done to my niece? <END>
did i impale him with the regal crown? <END>
did i put henry from his native right? <END>
and am i guerdon'd at the last with shame? <END>
shame on himself! for my desert is honour: <END>
and to repair my honour lost for him, <END>
i here renounce him and return to henry. <END>
my noble queen, let former grudges pass, <END>
and henceforth i am thy true servitor: <END>
i will revenge his wrong to lady bona, <END>
and replant henry in his former state. <END>
warwick, these words have turn'd my hate to love; <END>
and i forgive and quite forget old faults, <END>
and joy that thou becomest king henry's friend. <END>
so much his friend, ay, his unfeigned friend, <END>
that, if king lewis vouchsafe to furnish us <END>
with some few bands of chosen soldiers, <END>
i'll undertake to land them on our coast <END>
and force the tyrant from his seat by war. <END>
'tis not his new-made bride shall succor him: <END>
and as for clarence, as my letters tell me, <END>
he's very likely now to fall from him, <END>
for matching more for wanton lust than honour, <END>
or than for strength and safety of our country. <END>
dear brother, how shall bona be revenged <END>
but by thy help to this distressed queen? <END>
renowned prince, how shall poor henry live, <END>
unless thou rescue him from foul despair? <END>
my quarrel and this english queen's are one. <END>
and mine, fair lady bona, joins with yours. <END>
and mine with hers, and thine, and margaret's. <END>
therefore at last i firmly am resolved <END>
you shall have aid. <END>
let me give humble thanks for all at once. <END>
then, england's messenger, return in post, <END>
and tell false edward, thy supposed king, <END>
that lewis of france is sending over masquers <END>
to revel it with him and his new bride: <END>
thou seest what's past, go fear thy king withal. <END>
tell him, in hope he'll prove a widower shortly, <END>
i'll wear the willow garland for his sake. <END>
tell him, my mourning weeds are laid aside, <END>
and i am ready to put armour on. <END>
tell him from me that he hath done me wrong, <END>
and therefore i'll uncrown him ere't be long. <END>
there's thy reward: be gone. <END>
but, warwick, <END>
thou and oxford, with five thousand men, <END>
shall cross the seas, and bid false edward battle; <END>
and, as occasion serves, this noble queen <END>
and prince shall follow with a fresh supply. <END>
yet, ere thou go, but answer me one doubt, <END>
what pledge have we of thy firm loyalty? <END>
this shall assure my constant loyalty, <END>
that if our queen and this young prince agree, <END>
i'll join mine eldest daughter and my joy <END>
to him forthwith in holy wedlock bands. <END>
yes, i agree, and thank you for your motion. <END>
son edward, she is fair and virtuous, <END>
therefore delay not, give thy hand to warwick; <END>
and, with thy hand, thy faith irrevocable, <END>
that only warwick's daughter shall be thine. <END>
yes, i accept her, for she well deserves it; <END>
and here, to pledge my vow, i give my hand. <END>
why stay we now? these soldiers shall be levied, <END>
and thou, lord bourbon, our high admiral, <END>
shalt waft them over with our royal fleet. <END>
i long till edward fall by war's mischance, <END>
for mocking marriage with a dame of france. <END>
i came from edward as ambassador, <END>
but i return his sworn and mortal foe: <END>
matter of marriage was the charge he gave me, <END>
but dreadful war shall answer his demand. <END>
had he none else to make a stale but me? <END>
then none but i shall turn his jest to sorrow. <END>
i was the chief that raised him to the crown, <END>
and i'll be chief to bring him down again: <END>
not that i pity henry's misery, <END>
but seek revenge on edward's mockery. <END>
3 king henry vi <END>
now tell me, brother clarence, what think you <END>
of this new marriage with the lady grey? <END>
hath not our brother made a worthy choice? <END>
alas, you know, 'tis far from hence to france; <END>
how could he stay till warwick made return? <END>
my lords, forbear this talk; here comes the king. <END>
and his well-chosen bride. <END>
i mind to tell him plainly what i think. <END>
now, brother of clarence, how like you our choice, <END>
that you stand pensive, as half malcontent? <END>
as well as lewis of france, or the earl of warwick, <END>
which are so weak of courage and in judgment <END>
that they'll take no offence at our abuse. <END>
suppose they take offence without a cause, <END>
they are but lewis and warwick: i am edward, <END>
your king and warwick's, and must have my will. <END>
and shall have your will, because our king: <END>
yet hasty marriage seldom proveth well. <END>
yea, brother richard, are you offended too? <END>
not i: <END>
no, god forbid that i should wish them sever'd <END>
whom god hath join'd together; ay, and 'twere pity <END>
to sunder them that yoke so well together. <END>
setting your scorns and your mislike aside, <END>
tell me some reason why the lady grey <END>
should not become my wife and england's queen. <END>
and you too, somerset and montague, <END>
speak freely what you think. <END>
then this is mine opinion: that king lewis <END>
becomes your enemy, for mocking him <END>
about the marriage of the lady bona. <END>
and warwick, doing what you gave in charge, <END>
is now dishonoured by this new marriage. <END>
what if both lewis and warwick be appeased <END>
by such invention as i can devise? <END>
yet, to have join'd with france in such alliance <END>
would more have strengthen'd this our commonwealth <END>
'gainst foreign storms than any home-bred marriage. <END>
why, knows not montague that of itself <END>
england is safe, if true within itself? <END>
but the safer when 'tis back'd with france. <END>
'tis better using france than trusting france: <END>
let us be back'd with god and with the seas <END>
which he hath given for fence impregnable, <END>
and with their helps only defend ourselves; <END>
in them and in ourselves our safety lies. <END>
for this one speech lord hastings well deserves <END>
to have the heir of the lord hungerford. <END>
ay, what of that? it was my will and grant; <END>
and for this once my will shall stand for law. <END>
and yet methinks your grace hath not done well, <END>
to give the heir and daughter of lord scales <END>
unto the brother of your loving bride; <END>
she better would have fitted me or clarence: <END>
but in your bride you bury brotherhood. <END>
or else you would not have bestow'd the heir <END>
of the lord bonville on your new wife's son, <END>
and leave your brothers to go speed elsewhere. <END>
alas, poor clarence! is it for a wife <END>
that thou art malcontent? i will provide thee. <END>
in choosing for yourself, you show'd your judgment, <END>
which being shallow, you give me leave <END>
to play the broker in mine own behalf; <END>
and to that end i shortly mind to leave you. <END>
leave me, or tarry, edward will be king, <END>
and not be tied unto his brother's will. <END>
my lords, before it pleased his majesty <END>
to raise my state to title of a queen, <END>
do me but right, and you must all confess <END>
that i was not ignoble of descent; <END>
and meaner than myself have had like fortune. <END>
but as this title honours me and mine, <END>
so your dislike, to whom i would be pleasing, <END>
doth cloud my joys with danger and with sorrow. <END>
my love, forbear to fawn upon their frowns: <END>
what danger or what sorrow can befall thee, <END>
so long as edward is thy constant friend, <END>
and their true sovereign, whom they must obey? <END>
nay, whom they shall obey, and love thee too, <END>
unless they seek for hatred at my hands; <END>
which if they do, yet will i keep thee safe, <END>
and they shall feel the vengeance of my wrath. <END>
now, messenger, what letters or what news <END>
from france? <END>
my sovereign liege, no letters; and few words, <END>
but such as i, without your special pardon, <END>
dare not relate. <END>
go to, we pardon thee: therefore, in brief, <END>
tell me their words as near as thou canst guess them. <END>
what answer makes king lewis unto our letters? <END>
at my depart, these were his very words: <END>
'go tell false edward, thy supposed king, <END>
that lewis of france is sending over masquers <END>
to revel it with him and his new bride.' <END>
is lewis so brave? belike he thinks me henry. <END>
but what said lady bona to my marriage? <END>
these were her words, utter'd with mad disdain: <END>
'tell him, in hope he'll prove a widower shortly, <END>
i'll wear the willow garland for his sake.' <END>
i blame not her, she could say little less; <END>
she had the wrong. but what said henry's queen? <END>
for i have heard that she was there in place. <END>
'tell him,' quoth she, 'my mourning weeds are done, <END>
and i am ready to put armour on.' <END>
belike she minds to play the amazon. <END>
but what said warwick to these injuries? <END>
he, more incensed against your majesty <END>
than all the rest, discharged me with these words: <END>
'tell him from me that he hath done me wrong, <END>
and therefore i'll uncrown him ere't be long.' <END>
ha! durst the traitor breathe out so proud words? <END>
well i will arm me, being thus forewarn'd: <END>
they shall have wars and pay for their presumption. <END>
but say, is warwick friends with margaret? <END>
ay, gracious sovereign; they are so link'd in <END>
friendship <END>
that young prince edward marries warwick's daughter. <END>
belike the elder; clarence will have the younger. <END>
now, brother king, farewell, and sit you fast, <END>
for i will hence to warwick's other daughter; <END>
that, though i want a kingdom, yet in marriage <END>
i may not prove inferior to yourself. <END>
you that love me and warwick, follow me. <END>
clarence and somerset both gone to warwick! <END>
yet am i arm'd against the worst can happen; <END>
and haste is needful in this desperate case. <END>
pembroke and stafford, you in our behalf <END>
go levy men, and make prepare for war; <END>
they are already, or quickly will be landed: <END>
myself in person will straight follow you. <END>
but, ere i go, hastings and montague, <END>
resolve my doubt. you twain, of all the rest, <END>
are near to warwick by blood and by alliance: <END>
tell me if you love warwick more than me? <END>
if it be so, then both depart to him; <END>
i rather wish you foes than hollow friends: <END>
but if you mind to hold your true obedience, <END>
give me assurance with some friendly vow, <END>
that i may never have you in suspect. <END>
so god help montague as he proves true! <END>
and hastings as he favours edward's cause! <END>
now, brother richard, will you stand by us? <END>
ay, in despite of all that shall withstand you. <END>
why, so! then am i sure of victory. <END>
now therefore let us hence; and lose no hour, <END>
till we meet warwick with his foreign power. <END>
3 king henry vi <END>
trust me, my lord, all hitherto goes well; <END>
the common people by numbers swarm to us. <END>
but see where somerset and clarence come! <END>
speak suddenly, my lords, are we all friends? <END>
fear not that, my lord. <END>
then, gentle clarence, welcome unto warwick; <END>
and welcome, somerset: i hold it cowardice <END>
to rest mistrustful where a noble heart <END>
hath pawn'd an open hand in sign of love; <END>
else might i think that clarence, edward's brother, <END>
were but a feigned friend to our proceedings: <END>
but welcome, sweet clarence; my daughter shall be thine. <END>
and now what rests but, in night's coverture, <END>
thy brother being carelessly encamp'd, <END>
his soldiers lurking in the towns about, <END>
and but attended by a simple guard, <END>
we may surprise and take him at our pleasure? <END>
our scouts have found the adventure very easy: <END>
that as ulysses and stout diomede <END>
with sleight and manhood stole to rhesus' tents, <END>
and brought from thence the thracian fatal steeds, <END>
so we, well cover'd with the night's black mantle, <END>
at unawares may beat down edward's guard <END>
and seize himself; i say not, slaughter him, <END>
for i intend but only to surprise him. <END>
you that will follow me to this attempt, <END>
applaud the name of henry with your leader. <END>
why, then, let's on our way in silent sort: <END>
for warwick and his friends, god and saint george! <END>
3 king henry vi <END>
come on, my masters, each man take his stand: <END>
the king by this is set him down to sleep. <END>
what, will he not to bed? <END>
why, no; for he hath made a solemn vow <END>
never to lie and take his natural rest <END>
till warwick or himself be quite suppress'd. <END>
to-morrow then belike shall be the day, <END>
if warwick be so near as men report. <END>
but say, i pray, what nobleman is that <END>
that with the king here resteth in his tent? <END>
'tis the lord hastings, the king's chiefest friend. <END>
o, is it so? but why commands the king <END>
that his chief followers lodge in towns about him, <END>
while he himself keeps in the cold field? <END>
'tis the more honour, because more dangerous. <END>
ay, but give me worship and quietness; <END>
i like it better than a dangerous honour. <END>
if warwick knew in what estate he stands, <END>
'tis to be doubted he would waken him. <END>
unless our halberds did shut up his passage. <END>
ay, wherefore else guard we his royal tent, <END>
but to defend his person from night-foes? <END>
this is his tent; and see where stand his guard. <END>
courage, my masters! honour now or never! <END>
but follow me, and edward shall be ours. <END>
who goes there? <END>
stay, or thou diest! <END>
what are they that fly there? <END>
richard and hastings: let them go; here is the duke. <END>
the duke! why, warwick, when we parted, <END>
thou call'dst me king. <END>
ay, but the case is alter'd: <END>
when you disgraced me in my embassade, <END>
then i degraded you from being king, <END>
and come now to create you duke of york. <END>
alas! how should you govern any kingdom, <END>
that know not how to use ambassadors, <END>
nor how to be contented with one wife, <END>
nor how to use your brothers brotherly, <END>
nor how to study for the people's welfare, <END>
nor how to shroud yourself from enemies? <END>
yea, brother of clarence, are thou here too? <END>
nay, then i see that edward needs must down. <END>
yet, warwick, in despite of all mischance, <END>
of thee thyself and all thy complices, <END>
edward will always bear himself as king: <END>
though fortune's malice overthrow my state, <END>
my mind exceeds the compass of her wheel. <END>
then, for his mind, be edward england's king: <END>
but henry now shall wear the english crown, <END>
and be true king indeed, thou but the shadow. <END>
my lord of somerset, at my request, <END>
see that forthwith duke edward be convey'd <END>
unto my brother, archbishop of york. <END>
when i have fought with pembroke and his fellows, <END>
i'll follow you, and tell what answer <END>
lewis and the lady bona send to him. <END>
now, for a while farewell, good duke of york. <END>
what fates impose, that men must needs abide; <END>
it boots not to resist both wind and tide. <END>
what now remains, my lords, for us to do <END>
but march to london with our soldiers? <END>
ay, that's the first thing that we have to do; <END>
to free king henry from imprisonment <END>
and see him seated in the regal throne. <END>
3 king henry vi <END>
madam, what makes you in this sudden change? <END>
why brother rivers, are you yet to learn <END>
what late misfortune is befall'n king edward? <END>
what! loss of some pitch'd battle against warwick? <END>
no, but the loss of his own royal person. <END>
then is my sovereign slain? <END>
ay, almost slain, for he is taken prisoner, <END>
either betray'd by falsehood of his guard <END>
or by his foe surprised at unawares: <END>
and, as i further have to understand, <END>
is new committed to the bishop of york, <END>
fell warwick's brother and by that our foe. <END>
these news i must confess are full of grief; <END>
yet, gracious madam, bear it as you may: <END>
warwick may lose, that now hath won the day. <END>
till then fair hope must hinder life's decay. <END>
and i the rather wean me from despair <END>
for love of edward's offspring in my womb: <END>
this is it that makes me bridle passion <END>
and bear with mildness my misfortune's cross; <END>
ay, ay, for this i draw in many a tear <END>
and stop the rising of blood-sucking sighs, <END>
lest with my sighs or tears i blast or drown <END>
king edward's fruit, true heir to the english crown. <END>
but, madam, where is warwick then become? <END>
i am inform'd that he comes towards london, <END>
to set the crown once more on henry's head: <END>
guess thou the rest; king edward's friends must down, <END>
but, to prevent the tyrant's violence,-- <END>
for trust not him that hath once broken faith,-- <END>
i'll hence forthwith unto the sanctuary, <END>
to save at least the heir of edward's right: <END>
there shall i rest secure from force and fraud. <END>
come, therefore, let us fly while we may fly: <END>
if warwick take us we are sure to die. <END>
3 king henry vi <END>
now, my lord hastings and sir william stanley, <END>
leave off to wonder why i drew you hither, <END>
into this chiefest thicket of the park. <END>
thus stands the case: you know our king, my brother, <END>
is prisoner to the bishop here, at whose hands <END>
he hath good usage and great liberty, <END>
and, often but attended with weak guard, <END>
comes hunting this way to disport himself. <END>
i have advertised him by secret means <END>
that if about this hour he make his way <END>
under the colour of his usual game, <END>
he shall here find his friends with horse and men <END>
to set him free from his captivity. <END>
this way, my lord; for this way lies the game. <END>
nay, this way, man: see where the huntsmen stand. <END>
now, brother of gloucester, lord hastings, and the rest, <END>
stand you thus close, to steal the bishop's deer? <END>
brother, the time and case requireth haste: <END>
your horse stands ready at the park-corner. <END>
but whither shall we then? <END>
to lynn, my lord, <END>
and ship from thence to flanders. <END>
well guess'd, believe me; for that was my meaning. <END>
stanley, i will requite thy forwardness. <END>
but wherefore stay we? 'tis no time to talk. <END>
huntsman, what say'st thou? wilt thou go along? <END>
better do so than tarry and be hang'd. <END>
come then, away; let's ha' no more ado. <END>
bishop, farewell: shield thee from warwick's frown; <END>
and pray that i may repossess the crown. <END>
3 king henry vi <END>
master lieutenant, now that god and friends <END>
have shaken edward from the regal seat, <END>
and turn'd my captive state to liberty, <END>
my fear to hope, my sorrows unto joys, <END>
at our enlargement what are thy due fees? <END>
subjects may challenge nothing of their sovereigns; <END>
but if an humble prayer may prevail, <END>
i then crave pardon of your majesty. <END>
for what, lieutenant? for well using me? <END>
nay, be thou sure i'll well requite thy kindness, <END>
for that it made my imprisonment a pleasure; <END>
ay, such a pleasure as incaged birds <END>
conceive when after many moody thoughts <END>
at last by notes of household harmony <END>
they quite forget their loss of liberty. <END>
but, warwick, after god, thou set'st me free, <END>
and chiefly therefore i thank god and thee; <END>
he was the author, thou the instrument. <END>
therefore, that i may conquer fortune's spite <END>
by living low, where fortune cannot hurt me, <END>
and that the people of this blessed land <END>
may not be punish'd with my thwarting stars, <END>
warwick, although my head still wear the crown, <END>
i here resign my government to thee, <END>
for thou art fortunate in all thy deeds. <END>
your grace hath still been famed for virtuous; <END>
and now may seem as wise as virtuous, <END>
by spying and avoiding fortune's malice, <END>
for few men rightly temper with the stars: <END>
yet in this one thing let me blame your grace, <END>
for choosing me when clarence is in place. <END>
no, warwick, thou art worthy of the sway, <END>
to whom the heavens in thy nativity <END>
adjudged an olive branch and laurel crown, <END>
as likely to be blest in peace and war; <END>
and therefore i yield thee my free consent. <END>
and i choose clarence only for protector. <END>
warwick and clarence give me both your hands: <END>
now join your hands, and with your hands your hearts, <END>
that no dissension hinder government: <END>
i make you both protectors of this land, <END>
while i myself will lead a private life <END>
and in devotion spend my latter days, <END>
to sin's rebuke and my creator's praise. <END>
what answers clarence to his sovereign's will? <END>
that he consents, if warwick yield consent; <END>
for on thy fortune i repose myself. <END>
why, then, though loath, yet must i be content: <END>
we'll yoke together, like a double shadow <END>
to henry's body, and supply his place; <END>
i mean, in bearing weight of government, <END>
while he enjoys the honour and his ease. <END>
and, clarence, now then it is more than needful <END>
forthwith that edward be pronounced a traitor, <END>
and all his lands and goods be confiscate. <END>
what else? and that succession be determined. <END>
ay, therein clarence shall not want his part. <END>
but, with the first of all your chief affairs, <END>
let me entreat, for i command no more, <END>
that margaret your queen and my son edward <END>
be sent for, to return from france with speed; <END>
for, till i see them here, by doubtful fear <END>
my joy of liberty is half eclipsed. <END>
it shall be done, my sovereign, with all speed. <END>
my lord of somerset, what youth is that, <END>
of whom you seem to have so tender care? <END>
my liege, it is young henry, earl of richmond. <END>
come hither, england's hope. <END>
if secret powers <END>
suggest but truth to my divining thoughts, <END>
this pretty lad will prove our country's bliss. <END>
his looks are full of peaceful majesty, <END>
his head by nature framed to wear a crown, <END>
his hand to wield a sceptre, and himself <END>
likely in time to bless a regal throne. <END>
make much of him, my lords, for this is he <END>
must help you more than you are hurt by me. <END>
what news, my friend? <END>
that edward is escaped from your brother, <END>
and fled, as he hears since, to burgundy. <END>
unsavoury news! but how made he escape? <END>
he was convey'd by richard duke of gloucester <END>
and the lord hastings, who attended him <END>
in secret ambush on the forest side <END>
and from the bishop's huntsmen rescued him; <END>
for hunting was his daily exercise. <END>
my brother was too careless of his charge. <END>
but let us hence, my sovereign, to provide <END>
a salve for any sore that may betide. <END>
my lord, i like not of this flight of edward's; <END>
for doubtless burgundy will yield him help, <END>
and we shall have more wars before 't be long. <END>
as henry's late presaging prophecy <END>
did glad my heart with hope of this young richmond, <END>
so doth my heart misgive me, in these conflicts <END>
what may befall him, to his harm and ours: <END>
therefore, lord oxford, to prevent the worst, <END>
forthwith we'll send him hence to brittany, <END>
till storms be past of civil enmity. <END>
ay, for if edward repossess the crown, <END>
'tis like that richmond with the rest shall down. <END>
it shall be so; he shall to brittany. <END>
come, therefore, let's about it speedily. <END>
3 king henry vi <END>
now, brother richard, lord hastings, and the rest, <END>
yet thus far fortune maketh us amends, <END>
and says that once more i shall interchange <END>
my waned state for henry's regal crown. <END>
well have we pass'd and now repass'd the seas <END>
and brought desired help from burgundy: <END>
what then remains, we being thus arrived <END>
from ravenspurgh haven before the gates of york, <END>
but that we enter, as into our dukedom? <END>
the gates made fast! brother, i like not this; <END>
for many men that stumble at the threshold <END>
are well foretold that danger lurks within. <END>
tush, man, abodements must not now affright us: <END>
by fair or foul means we must enter in, <END>
for hither will our friends repair to us. <END>
my liege, i'll knock once more to summon them. <END>
my lords, we were forewarned of your coming, <END>
and shut the gates for safety of ourselves; <END>
for now we owe allegiance unto henry. <END>
but, master mayor, if henry be your king, <END>
yet edward at the least is duke of york. <END>
true, my good lord; i know you for no less. <END>
why, and i challenge nothing but my dukedom, <END>
as being well content with that alone. <END>
why, master mayor, why stand you in a doubt? <END>
open the gates; we are king henry's friends. <END>
ay, say you so? the gates shall then be open'd. <END>
a wise stout captain, and soon persuaded! <END>
the good old man would fain that all were well, <END>
so 'twere not 'long of him; but being enter'd, <END>
i doubt not, i, but we shall soon persuade <END>
both him and all his brothers unto reason. <END>
so, master mayor: these gates must not be shut <END>
but in the night or in the time of war. <END>
what! fear not, man, but yield me up the keys; <END>
for edward will defend the town and thee, <END>
and all those friends that deign to follow me. <END>
brother, this is sir john montgomery, <END>
our trusty friend, unless i be deceived. <END>
welcome, sir john! but why come you in arms? <END>
to help king edward in his time of storm, <END>
as every loyal subject ought to do. <END>
thanks, good montgomery; but we now forget <END>
our title to the crown and only claim <END>
our dukedom till god please to send the rest. <END>
then fare you well, for i will hence again: <END>
i came to serve a king and not a duke. <END>
drummer, strike up, and let us march away. <END>
nay, stay, sir john, awhile, and we'll debate <END>
by what safe means the crown may be recover'd. <END>
what talk you of debating? in few words, <END>
if you'll not here proclaim yourself our king, <END>
i'll leave you to your fortune and be gone <END>
to keep them back that come to succor you: <END>
why shall we fight, if you pretend no title? <END>
why, brother, wherefore stand you on nice points? <END>
when we grow stronger, then we'll make our claim: <END>
till then, 'tis wisdom to conceal our meaning. <END>
away with scrupulous wit! now arms must rule. <END>
and fearless minds climb soonest unto crowns. <END>
brother, we will proclaim you out of hand: <END>
the bruit thereof will bring you many friends. <END>
then be it as you will; for 'tis my right, <END>
and henry but usurps the diadem. <END>
ay, now my sovereign speaketh like himself; <END>
and now will i be edward's champion. <END>
sound trumpet; edward shall be here proclaim'd: <END>
come, fellow-soldier, make thou proclamation. <END>
edward the fourth, by the grace of god, king of <END>
england and france, and lord of ireland, &c. <END>
and whosoe'er gainsays king edward's right, <END>
by this i challenge him to single fight. <END>
long live edward the fourth! <END>
thanks, brave montgomery; and thanks unto you all: <END>
if fortune serve me, i'll requite this kindness. <END>
now, for this night, let's harbour here in york; <END>
and when the morning sun shall raise his car <END>
above the border of this horizon, <END>
we'll forward towards warwick and his mates; <END>
for well i wot that henry is no soldier. <END>
ah, froward clarence! how evil it beseems thee <END>
to flatter henry and forsake thy brother! <END>
yet, as we may, we'll meet both thee and warwick. <END>
come on, brave soldiers: doubt not of the day, <END>
and, that once gotten, doubt not of large pay. <END>
3 king henry vi <END>
what counsel, lords? edward from belgia, <END>
with hasty germans and blunt hollanders, <END>
hath pass'd in safety through the narrow seas, <END>
and with his troops doth march amain to london; <END>
and many giddy people flock to him. <END>
let's levy men, and beat him back again. <END>
a little fire is quickly trodden out; <END>
which, being suffer'd, rivers cannot quench. <END>
in warwickshire i have true-hearted friends, <END>
not mutinous in peace, yet bold in war; <END>
those will i muster up: and thou, son clarence, <END>
shalt stir up in suffolk, norfolk, and in kent, <END>
the knights and gentlemen to come with thee: <END>
thou, brother montague, in buckingham, <END>
northampton and in leicestershire, shalt find <END>
men well inclined to hear what thou command'st: <END>
and thou, brave oxford, wondrous well beloved, <END>
in oxfordshire shalt muster up thy friends. <END>
my sovereign, with the loving citizens, <END>
like to his island girt in with the ocean, <END>
or modest dian circled with her nymphs, <END>
shall rest in london till we come to him. <END>
fair lords, take leave and stand not to reply. <END>
farewell, my sovereign. <END>
farewell, my hector, and my troy's true hope. <END>
in sign of truth, i kiss your highness' hand. <END>
well-minded clarence, be thou fortunate! <END>
comfort, my lord; and so i take my leave. <END>
and thus i seal my truth, and bid adieu. <END>
sweet oxford, and my loving montague, <END>
and all at once, once more a happy farewell. <END>
farewell, sweet lords: let's meet at coventry. <END>
here at the palace i will rest awhile. <END>
cousin of exeter, what thinks your lordship? <END>
methinks the power that edward hath in field <END>
should not be able to encounter mine. <END>
the doubt is that he will seduce the rest. <END>
that's not my fear; my meed hath got me fame: <END>
i have not stopp'd mine ears to their demands, <END>
nor posted off their suits with slow delays; <END>
my pity hath been balm to heal their wounds, <END>
my mildness hath allay'd their swelling griefs, <END>
my mercy dried their water-flowing tears; <END>
i have not been desirous of their wealth, <END>
nor much oppress'd them with great subsidies. <END>
nor forward of revenge, though they much err'd: <END>
then why should they love edward more than me? <END>
no, exeter, these graces challenge grace: <END>
and when the lion fawns upon the lamb, <END>
the lamb will never cease to follow him. <END>
hark, hark, my lord! what shouts are these? <END>
seize on the shame-faced henry, bear him hence; <END>
and once again proclaim us king of england. <END>
you are the fount that makes small brooks to flow: <END>
now stops thy spring; my sea sha$l suck them dry, <END>
and swell so much the higher by their ebb. <END>
hence with him to the tower; let him not speak. <END>
and, lords, towards coventry bend we our course <END>
where peremptory warwick now remains: <END>
the sun shines hot; and, if we use delay, <END>
cold biting winter mars our hoped-for hay. <END>
away betimes, before his forces join, <END>
and take the great-grown traitor unawares: <END>
brave warriors, march amain towards coventry. <END>
3 king henry vi <END>
where is the post that came from valiant oxford? <END>
how far hence is thy lord, mine honest fellow? <END>
by this at dunsmore, marching hitherward. <END>
how far off is our brother montague? <END>
where is the post that came from montague? <END>
by this at daintry, with a puissant troop. <END>
say, somerville, what says my loving son? <END>
and, by thy guess, how nigh is clarence now? <END>
at southam i did leave him with his forces, <END>
and do expect him here some two hours hence. <END>
then clarence is at hand, i hear his drum. <END>
it is not his, my lord; here southam lies: <END>
the drum your honour hears marcheth from warwick. <END>
who should that be? belike, unlook'd-for friends. <END>
they are at hand, and you shall quickly know. <END>
go, trumpet, to the walls, and sound a parle. <END>
see how the surly warwick mans the wall! <END>
o unbid spite! is sportful edward come? <END>
where slept our scouts, or how are they seduced, <END>
that we could hear no news of his repair? <END>
now, warwick, wilt thou ope the city gates, <END>
speak gentle words and humbly bend thy knee, <END>
call edward king and at his hands beg mercy? <END>
and he shall pardon thee these outrages. <END>
nay, rather, wilt thou draw thy forces hence, <END>
confess who set thee up and pluck'd thee own, <END>
call warwick patron and be penitent? <END>
and thou shalt still remain the duke of york. <END>
i thought, at least, he would have said the king; <END>
or did he make the jest against his will? <END>
is not a dukedom, sir, a goodly gift? <END>
ay, by my faith, for a poor earl to give: <END>
i'll do thee service for so good a gift. <END>
'twas i that gave the kingdom to thy brother. <END>
why then 'tis mine, if but by warwick's gift. <END>
thou art no atlas for so great a weight: <END>
and weakling, warwick takes his gift again; <END>
and henry is my king, warwick his subject. <END>
but warwick's king is edward's prisoner: <END>
and, gallant warwick, do but answer this: <END>
what is the body when the head is off? <END>
alas, that warwick had no more forecast, <END>
but, whiles he thought to steal the single ten, <END>
the king was slily finger'd from the deck! <END>
you left poor henry at the bishop's palace, <END>
and, ten to one, you'll meet him in the tower. <END>
'tis even so; yet you are warwick still. <END>
come, warwick, take the time; kneel down, kneel down: <END>
nay, when? strike now, or else the iron cools. <END>
i had rather chop this hand off at a blow, <END>
and with the other fling it at thy face, <END>
than bear so low a sail, to strike to thee. <END>
sail how thou canst, have wind and tide thy friend, <END>
this hand, fast wound about thy coal-black hair <END>
shall, whiles thy head is warm and new cut off, <END>
write in the dust this sentence with thy blood, <END>
'wind-changing warwick now can change no more.' <END>
o cheerful colours! see where oxford comes! <END>
oxford, oxford, for lancaster! <END>
the gates are open, let us enter too. <END>
so other foes may set upon our backs. <END>
stand we in good array; for they no doubt <END>
will issue out again and bid us battle: <END>
if not, the city being but of small defence, <END>
we'll quickly rouse the traitors in the same. <END>
o, welcome, oxford! for we want thy help. <END>
montague, montague, for lancaster! <END>
thou and thy brother both shall buy this treason <END>
even with the dearest blood your bodies bear. <END>
the harder match'd, the greater victory: <END>
my mind presageth happy gain and conquest. <END>
somerset, somerset, for lancaster! <END>
two of thy name, both dukes of somerset, <END>
have sold their lives unto the house of york; <END>
and thou shalt be the third if this sword hold. <END>
and lo, where george of clarence sweeps along, <END>
of force enough to bid his brother battle; <END>
with whom an upright zeal to right prevails <END>
more than the nature of a brother's love! <END>
come, clarence, come; thou wilt, if warwick call. <END>
father of warwick, know you what this means? <END>
look here, i throw my infamy at thee <END>
i will not ruinate my father's house, <END>
who gave his blood to lime the stones together, <END>
and set up lancaster. why, trow'st thou, warwick, <END>
that clarence is so harsh, so blunt, unnatural, <END>
to bend the fatal instruments of war <END>
against his brother and his lawful king? <END>
perhaps thou wilt object my holy oath: <END>
to keep that oath were more impiety <END>
than jephthah's, when he sacrificed his daughter. <END>
i am so sorry for my trespass made <END>
that, to deserve well at my brother's hands, <END>
i here proclaim myself thy mortal foe, <END>
with resolution, wheresoe'er i meet thee-- <END>
as i will meet thee, if thou stir abroad-- <END>
to plague thee for thy foul misleading me. <END>
and so, proud-hearted warwick, i defy thee, <END>
and to my brother turn my blushing cheeks. <END>
pardon me, edward, i will make amends: <END>
and, richard, do not frown upon my faults, <END>
for i will henceforth be no more unconstant. <END>
now welcome more, and ten times more beloved, <END>
than if thou never hadst deserved our hate. <END>
welcome, good clarence; this is brotherlike. <END>
o passing traitor, perjured and unjust! <END>
what, warwick, wilt thou leave the town and fight? <END>
or shall we beat the stones about thine ears? <END>
alas, i am not coop'd here for defence! <END>
i will away towards barnet presently, <END>
and bid thee battle, edward, if thou darest. <END>
yes, warwick, edward dares, and leads the way. <END>
lords, to the field; saint george and victory! <END>
3 king henry vi <END>
so, lie thou there: die thou, and die our fear; <END>
for warwick was a bug that fear'd us all. <END>
now, montague, sit fast; i seek for thee, <END>
that warwick's bones may keep thine company. <END>
ah, who is nigh? come to me, friend or foe, <END>
and tell me who is victor, york or warwick? <END>
why ask i that? my mangled body shows, <END>
my blood, my want of strength, my sick heart shows. <END>
that i must yield my body to the earth <END>
and, by my fall, the conquest to my foe. <END>
thus yields the cedar to the axe's edge, <END>
whose arms gave shelter to the princely eagle, <END>
under whose shade the ramping lion slept, <END>
whose top-branch overpeer'd jove's spreading tree <END>
and kept low shrubs from winter's powerful wind. <END>
these eyes, that now are dimm'd with death's black veil, <END>
have been as piercing as the mid-day sun, <END>
to search the secret treasons of the world: <END>
the wrinkles in my brows, now filled with blood, <END>
were liken'd oft to kingly sepulchres; <END>
for who lived king, but i could dig his grave? <END>
and who durst mine when warwick bent his brow? <END>
lo, now my glory smear'd in dust and blood! <END>
my parks, my walks, my manors that i had. <END>
even now forsake me, and of all my lands <END>
is nothing left me but my body's length. <END>
why, what is pomp, rule, reign, but earth and dust? <END>
and, live we how we can, yet die we must. <END>
ah, warwick, warwick! wert thou as we are. <END>
we might recover all our loss again; <END>
the queen from france hath brought a puissant power: <END>
even now we heard the news: ah, could'st thou fly! <END>
why, then i would not fly. ah, montague, <END>
if thou be there, sweet brother, take my hand. <END>
and with thy lips keep in my soul awhile! <END>
thou lovest me not; for, brother, if thou didst, <END>
thy tears would wash this cold congealed blood <END>
that glues my lips and will not let me speak. <END>
come quickly, montague, or i am dead. <END>
ah, warwick! montague hath breathed his last; <END>
and to the latest gasp cried out for warwick, <END>
and said 'commend me to my valiant brother.' <END>
and more he would have said, and more he spoke, <END>
which sounded like a clamour in a vault, <END>
that mought not be distinguished; but at last <END>
i well might hear, delivered with a groan, <END>
'o, farewell, warwick!' <END>
sweet rest his soul! fly, lords, and save yourselves; <END>
for warwick bids you all farewell to meet in heaven. <END>
away, away, to meet the queen's great power! <END>
3 king henry vi <END>
thus far our fortune keeps an upward course, <END>
and we are graced with wreaths of victory. <END>
but, in the midst of this bright-shining day, <END>
i spy a black, suspicious, threatening cloud, <END>
that will encounter with our glorious sun, <END>
ere he attain his easeful western bed: <END>
i mean, my lords, those powers that the queen <END>
hath raised in gallia have arrived our coast <END>
and, as we hear, march on to fight with us. <END>
a little gale will soon disperse that cloud <END>
and blow it to the source from whence it came: <END>
the very beams will dry those vapours up, <END>
for every cloud engenders not a storm. <END>
the queen is valued thirty thousand strong, <END>
and somerset, with oxford fled to her: <END>
if she have time to breathe be well assured <END>
her faction will be full as strong as ours. <END>
we are advertised by our loving friends <END>
that they do hold their course toward tewksbury: <END>
we, having now the best at barnet field, <END>
will thither straight, for willingness rids way; <END>
and, as we march, our strength will be augmented <END>
in every county as we go along. <END>
strike up the drum; cry 'courage!' and away. <END>
3 king henry vi <END>
great lords, wise men ne'er sit and wail their loss, <END>
but cheerly seek how to redress their harms. <END>
what though the mast be now blown overboard, <END>
the cable broke, the holding-anchor lost, <END>
and half our sailors swallow'd in the flood? <END>
yet lives our pilot still. is't meet that he <END>
should leave the helm and like a fearful lad <END>
with tearful eyes add water to the sea <END>
and give more strength to that which hath too much, <END>
whiles, in his moan, the ship splits on the rock, <END>
which industry and courage might have saved? <END>
ah, what a shame! ah, what a fault were this! <END>
say warwick was our anchor; what of that? <END>
and montague our topmost; what of him? <END>
our slaughter'd friends the tackles; what of these? <END>
why, is not oxford here another anchor? <END>
and somerset another goodly mast? <END>
the friends of france our shrouds and tacklings? <END>
and, though unskilful, why not ned and i <END>
for once allow'd the skilful pilot's charge? <END>
we will not from the helm to sit and weep, <END>
but keep our course, though the rough wind say no, <END>
from shelves and rocks that threaten us with wreck. <END>
as good to chide the waves as speak them fair. <END>
and what is edward but ruthless sea? <END>
what clarence but a quicksand of deceit? <END>
and richard but a ragged fatal rock? <END>
all these the enemies to our poor bark. <END>
say you can swim; alas, 'tis but a while! <END>
tread on the sand; why, there you quickly sink: <END>
bestride the rock; the tide will wash you off, <END>
or else you famish; that's a threefold death. <END>
this speak i, lords, to let you understand, <END>
if case some one of you would fly from us, <END>
that there's no hoped-for mercy with the brothers <END>
more than with ruthless waves, with sands and rocks. <END>
why, courage then! what cannot be avoided <END>
'twere childish weakness to lament or fear. <END>
methinks a woman of this valiant spirit <END>
should, if a coward heard her speak these words, <END>
infuse his breast with magnanimity <END>
and make him, naked, foil a man at arms. <END>
i speak not this as doubting any here <END>
for did i but suspect a fearful man <END>
he should have leave to go away betimes, <END>
lest in our need he might infect another <END>
and make him of like spirit to himself. <END>
if any such be here--as god forbid!-- <END>
let him depart before we need his help. <END>
women and children of so high a courage, <END>
and warriors faint! why, 'twere perpetual shame. <END>
o brave young prince! thy famous grandfather <END>
doth live again in thee: long mayst thou live <END>
to bear his image and renew his glories! <END>
and he that will not fight for such a hope. <END>
go home to bed, and like the owl by day, <END>
if he arise, be mock'd and wonder'd at. <END>
thanks, gentle somerset; sweet oxford, thanks. <END>
and take his thanks that yet hath nothing else. <END>
prepare you, lords, for edward is at hand. <END>
ready to fight; therefore be resolute. <END>
i thought no less: it is his policy <END>
to haste thus fast, to find us unprovided. <END>
but he's deceived; we are in readiness. <END>
this cheers my heart, to see your forwardness. <END>
here pitch our battle; hence we will not budge. <END>
brave followers, yonder stands the thorny wood, <END>
which, by the heavens' assistance and your strength, <END>
must by the roots be hewn up yet ere night. <END>
i need not add more fuel to your fire, <END>
for well i wot ye blaze to burn them out <END>
give signal to the fight, and to it, lords! <END>
lords, knights, and gentlemen, what i should say <END>
my tears gainsay; for every word i speak, <END>
ye see, i drink the water of mine eyes. <END>
therefore, no more but this: henry, your sovereign, <END>
is prisoner to the foe; his state usurp'd, <END>
his realm a slaughter-house, his subjects slain, <END>
his statutes cancell'd and his treasure spent; <END>
and yonder is the wolf that makes this spoil. <END>
you fight in justice: then, in god's name, lords, <END>
be valiant and give signal to the fight. <END>
3 king henry vi <END>
now here a period of tumultuous broils. <END>
away with oxford to hames castle straight: <END>
for somerset, off with his guilty head. <END>
go, bear them hence; i will not hear them speak. <END>
for my part, i'll not trouble thee with words. <END>
nor i, but stoop with patience to my fortune. <END>
so part we sadly in this troublous world, <END>
to meet with joy in sweet jerusalem. <END>
is proclamation made, that who finds edward <END>
shall have a high reward, and he his life? <END>
it is: and lo, where youthful edward comes! <END>
bring forth the gallant, let us hear him speak. <END>
what! can so young a thorn begin to prick? <END>
edward, what satisfaction canst thou make <END>
for bearing arms, for stirring up my subjects, <END>
and all the trouble thou hast turn'd me to? <END>
speak like a subject, proud ambitious york! <END>
suppose that i am now my father's mouth; <END>
resign thy chair, and where i stand kneel thou, <END>
whilst i propose the selfsame words to thee, <END>
which traitor, thou wouldst have me answer to. <END>
ah, that thy father had been so resolved! <END>
that you might still have worn the petticoat, <END>
and ne'er have stol'n the breech from lancaster. <END>
let aesop fable in a winter's night; <END>
his currish riddles sort not with this place. <END>
by heaven, brat, i'll plague ye for that word. <END>
ay, thou wast born to be a plague to men. <END>
for god's sake, take away this captive scold. <END>
nay, take away this scolding crookback rather. <END>
peace, wilful boy, or i will charm your tongue. <END>
untutor'd lad, thou art too malapert. <END>
i know my duty; you are all undutiful: <END>
lascivious edward, and thou perjured george, <END>
and thou mis-shapen dick, i tell ye all <END>
i am your better, traitors as ye are: <END>
and thou usurp'st my father's right and mine. <END>
take that, thou likeness of this railer here. <END>
sprawl'st thou? take that, to end thy agony. <END>
and there's for twitting me with perjury. <END>
o, kill me too! <END>
marry, and shall. <END>
hold, richard, hold; for we have done too much. <END>
why should she live, to fill the world with words? <END>
what, doth she swoon? use means for her recovery. <END>
clarence, excuse me to the king my brother; <END>
i'll hence to london on a serious matter: <END>
ere ye come there, be sure to hear some news. <END>
what? what? <END>
the tower, the tower. <END>
o ned, sweet ned! speak to thy mother, boy! <END>
canst thou not speak? o traitors! murderers! <END>
they that stabb'd caesar shed no blood at all, <END>
did not offend, nor were not worthy blame, <END>
if this foul deed were by to equal it: <END>
he was a man; this, in respect, a child: <END>
and men ne'er spend their fury on a child. <END>
what's worse than murderer, that i may name it? <END>
no, no, my heart will burst, and if i speak: <END>
and i will speak, that so my heart may burst. <END>
butchers and villains! bloody cannibals! <END>
how sweet a plant have you untimely cropp'd! <END>
you have no children, butchers! if you had, <END>
the thought of them would have stirr'd up remorse: <END>
but if you ever chance to have a child, <END>
look in his youth to have him so cut off <END>
as, deathmen, you have rid this sweet young prince! <END>
away with her; go, bear her hence perforce. <END>
nay, never bear me hence, dispatch me here, <END>
here sheathe thy sword, i'll pardon thee my death: <END>
what, wilt thou not? then, clarence, do it thou. <END>
by heaven, i will not do thee so much ease. <END>
good clarence, do; sweet clarence, do thou do it. <END>
didst thou not hear me swear i would not do it? <END>
ay, but thou usest to forswear thyself: <END>
'twas sin before, but now 'tis charity. <END>
what, wilt thou not? where is that devil's butcher, <END>
hard-favour'd richard? richard, where art thou? <END>
thou art not here: murder is thy alms-deed; <END>
petitioners for blood thou ne'er put'st back. <END>
away, i say; i charge ye, bear her hence. <END>
so come to you and yours, as to this prince! <END>
where's richard gone? <END>
to london, all in post; and, as i guess, <END>
to make a bloody supper in the tower. <END>
he's sudden, if a thing comes in his head. <END>
now march we hence: discharge the common sort <END>
with pay and thanks, and let's away to london <END>
and see our gentle queen how well she fares: <END>
by this, i hope, she hath a son for me. <END>
3 king henry vi <END>
good day, my lord. what, at your book so hard? <END>
ay, my good lord:--my lord, i should say rather; <END>
'tis sin to flatter; 'good' was little better: <END>
'good gloucester' and 'good devil' were alike, <END>
and both preposterous; therefore, not 'good lord.' <END>
sirrah, leave us to ourselves: we must confer. <END>
so flies the reckless shepherd from the wolf; <END>
so first the harmless sheep doth yield his fleece <END>
and next his throat unto the butcher's knife. <END>
what scene of death hath roscius now to act? <END>
suspicion always haunts the guilty mind; <END>
the thief doth fear each bush an officer. <END>
the bird that hath been limed in a bush, <END>
with trembling wings misdoubteth every bush; <END>
and i, the hapless male to one sweet bird, <END>
have now the fatal object in my eye <END>
where my poor young was limed, was caught and kill'd. <END>
why, what a peevish fool was that of crete, <END>
that taught his son the office of a fowl! <END>
an yet, for all his wings, the fool was drown'd. <END>
i, daedalus; my poor boy, icarus; <END>
thy father, minos, that denied our course; <END>
the sun that sear'd the wings of my sweet boy <END>
thy brother edward, and thyself the sea <END>
whose envious gulf did swallow up his life. <END>
ah, kill me with thy weapon, not with words! <END>
my breast can better brook thy dagger's point <END>
than can my ears that tragic history. <END>
but wherefore dost thou come? is't for my life? <END>
think'st thou i am an executioner? <END>
a persecutor, i am sure, thou art: <END>
if murdering innocents be executing, <END>
why, then thou art an executioner. <END>
thy son i kill'd for his presumption. <END>
hadst thou been kill'd when first thou didst presume, <END>
thou hadst not lived to kill a son of mine. <END>
and thus i prophesy, that many a thousand, <END>
which now mistrust no parcel of my fear, <END>
and many an old man's sigh and many a widow's, <END>
and many an orphan's water-standing eye-- <END>
men for their sons, wives for their husbands, <END>
and orphans for their parents timeless death-- <END>
shall rue the hour that ever thou wast born. <END>
the owl shriek'd at thy birth,--an evil sign; <END>
the night-crow cried, aboding luckless time; <END>
dogs howl'd, and hideous tempest shook down trees; <END>
the raven rook'd her on the chimney's top, <END>
and chattering pies in dismal discords sung. <END>
thy mother felt more than a mother's pain, <END>
and, yet brought forth less than a mother's hope, <END>
to wit, an indigested and deformed lump, <END>
not like the fruit of such a goodly tree. <END>
teeth hadst thou in thy head when thou wast born, <END>
to signify thou camest to bite the world: <END>
and, if the rest be true which i have heard, <END>
thou camest-- <END>
i'll hear no more: die, prophet in thy speech: <END>
for this amongst the rest, was i ordain'd. <END>
ay, and for much more slaughter after this. <END>
god forgive my sins, and pardon thee! <END>
what, will the aspiring blood of lancaster <END>
sink in the ground? i thought it would have mounted. <END>
see how my sword weeps for the poor king's death! <END>
o, may such purple tears be alway shed <END>
from those that wish the downfall of our house! <END>
if any spark of life be yet remaining, <END>
down, down to hell; and say i sent thee thither: <END>
i, that have neither pity, love, nor fear. <END>
indeed, 'tis true that henry told me of; <END>
for i have often heard my mother say <END>
i came into the world with my legs forward: <END>
had i not reason, think ye, to make haste, <END>
and seek their ruin that usurp'd our right? <END>
the midwife wonder'd and the women cried <END>
'o, jesus bless us, he is born with teeth!' <END>
and so i was; which plainly signified <END>
that i should snarl and bite and play the dog. <END>
then, since the heavens have shaped my body so, <END>
let hell make crook'd my mind to answer it. <END>
i have no brother, i am like no brother; <END>
and this word 'love,' which graybeards call divine, <END>
be resident in men like one another <END>
and not in me: i am myself alone. <END>
clarence, beware; thou keep'st me from the light: <END>
but i will sort a pitchy day for thee; <END>
for i will buz abroad such prophecies <END>
that edward shall be fearful of his life, <END>
and then, to purge his fear, i'll be thy death. <END>
king henry and the prince his son are gone: <END>
clarence, thy turn is next, and then the rest, <END>
counting myself but bad till i be best. <END>
i'll throw thy body in another room <END>
and triumph, henry, in thy day of doom. <END>
3 king henry vi <END>
once more we sit in england's royal throne, <END>
re-purchased with the blood of enemies. <END>
what valiant foemen, like to autumn's corn, <END>
have we mow'd down, in tops of all their pride! <END>
three dukes of somerset, threefold renown'd <END>
for hardy and undoubted champions; <END>
two cliffords, as the father and the son, <END>
and two northumberlands; two braver men <END>
ne'er spurr'd their coursers at the trumpet's sound; <END>
with them, the two brave bears, warwick and montague, <END>
that in their chains fetter'd the kingly lion <END>
and made the forest tremble when they roar'd. <END>
thus have we swept suspicion from our seat <END>
and made our footstool of security. <END>
come hither, bess, and let me kiss my boy. <END>
young ned, for thee, thine uncles and myself <END>
have in our armours watch'd the winter's night, <END>
went all afoot in summer's scalding heat, <END>
that thou mightst repossess the crown in peace; <END>
and of our labours thou shalt reap the gain. <END>
clarence and gloucester, love my lovely queen; <END>
and kiss your princely nephew, brothers both. <END>
the duty that i owe unto your majesty <END>
i seal upon the lips of this sweet babe. <END>
thanks, noble clarence; worthy brother, thanks. <END>
and, that i love the tree from whence thou sprang'st, <END>
witness the loving kiss i give the fruit. <END>
now am i seated as my soul delights, <END>
having my country's peace and brothers' loves. <END>
what will your grace have done with margaret? <END>
reignier, her father, to the king of france <END>
hath pawn'd the sicils and jerusalem, <END>
and hither have they sent it for her ransom. <END>
away with her, and waft her hence to france. <END>
and now what rests but that we spend the time <END>
with stately triumphs, mirthful comic shows, <END>
such as befits the pleasure of the court? <END>
sound drums and trumpets! farewell sour annoy! <END>
for here, i hope, begins our lasting joy. <END>
if you shall chance, camillo, to visit bohemia, on <END>
the like occasion whereon my services are now on <END>
foot, you shall see, as i have said, great <END>
difference betwixt our bohemia and your sicilia. <END>
i think, this coming summer, the king of sicilia <END>
means to pay bohemia the visitation which he justly owes him. <END>
wherein our entertainment shall shame us we will be <END>
justified in our loves; for indeed-- <END>
beseech you,-- <END>
verily, i speak it in the freedom of my knowledge: <END>
we cannot with such magnificence--in so rare--i know <END>
not what to say. we will give you sleepy drinks, <END>
that your senses, unintelligent of our insufficience, <END>
may, though they cannot praise us, as little accuse <END>
us. <END>
you pay a great deal too dear for what's given freely. <END>
believe me, i speak as my understanding instructs me <END>
and as mine honesty puts it to utterance. <END>
sicilia cannot show himself over-kind to bohemia. <END>
they were trained together in their childhoods; and <END>
there rooted betwixt them then such an affection, <END>
which cannot choose but branch now. since their <END>
more mature dignities and royal necessities made <END>
separation of their society, their encounters, <END>
though not personal, have been royally attorneyed <END>
with interchange of gifts, letters, loving <END>
embassies; that they have seemed to be together, <END>
though absent, shook hands, as over a vast, and <END>
embraced, as it were, from the ends of opposed <END>
winds. the heavens continue their loves! <END>
i think there is not in the world either malice or <END>
matter to alter it. you have an unspeakable <END>
comfort of your young prince mamillius: it is a <END>
gentleman of the greatest promise that ever came <END>
into my note. <END>
i very well agree with you in the hopes of him: it <END>
is a gallant child; one that indeed physics the <END>
subject, makes old hearts fresh: they that went on <END>
crutches ere he was born desire yet their life to <END>
see him a man. <END>
would they else be content to die? <END>
yes; if there were no other excuse why they should <END>
desire to live. <END>
if the king had no son, they would desire to live <END>
on crutches till he had one. <END>
nine changes of the watery star hath been <END>
the shepherd's note since we have left our throne <END>
without a burthen: time as long again <END>
would be find up, my brother, with our thanks; <END>
and yet we should, for perpetuity, <END>
go hence in debt: and therefore, like a cipher, <END>
yet standing in rich place, i multiply <END>
with one 'we thank you' many thousands moe <END>
that go before it. <END>
stay your thanks a while; <END>
and pay them when you part. <END>
sir, that's to-morrow. <END>
i am question'd by my fears, of what may chance <END>
or breed upon our absence; that may blow <END>
no sneaping winds at home, to make us say <END>
'this is put forth too truly:' besides, i have stay'd <END>
to tire your royalty. <END>
we are tougher, brother, <END>
than you can put us to't. <END>
no longer stay. <END>
one seven-night longer. <END>
very sooth, to-morrow. <END>
we'll part the time between's then; and in that <END>
i'll no gainsaying. <END>
press me not, beseech you, so. <END>
there is no tongue that moves, none, none i' the world, <END>
so soon as yours could win me: so it should now, <END>
were there necessity in your request, although <END>
'twere needful i denied it. my affairs <END>
do even drag me homeward: which to hinder <END>
were in your love a whip to me; my stay <END>
to you a charge and trouble: to save both, <END>
farewell, our brother. <END>
tongue-tied, our queen? <END>
speak you. <END>
i had thought, sir, to have held my peace until <END>
you have drawn oaths from him not to stay. you, sir, <END>
charge him too coldly. tell him, you are sure <END>
all in bohemia's well; this satisfaction <END>
the by-gone day proclaim'd: say this to him, <END>
he's beat from his best ward. <END>
well said, hermione. <END>
to tell, he longs to see his son, were strong: <END>
but let him say so then, and let him go; <END>
but let him swear so, and he shall not stay, <END>
we'll thwack him hence with distaffs. <END>
yet of your royal presence i'll adventure <END>
the borrow of a week. when at bohemia <END>
you take my lord, i'll give him my commission <END>
to let him there a month behind the gest <END>
prefix'd for's parting: yet, good deed, leontes, <END>
i love thee not a jar o' the clock behind <END>
what lady-she her lord. you'll stay? <END>
no, madam. <END>
nay, but you will? <END>
i may not, verily. <END>
verily! <END>
you put me off with limber vows; but i, <END>
though you would seek to unsphere the <END>
stars with oaths, <END>
should yet say 'sir, no going.' verily, <END>
you shall not go: a lady's 'verily' 's <END>
as potent as a lord's. will you go yet? <END>
force me to keep you as a prisoner, <END>
not like a guest; so you shall pay your fees <END>
when you depart, and save your thanks. how say you? <END>
my prisoner? or my guest? by your dread 'verily,' <END>
one of them you shall be. <END>
your guest, then, madam: <END>
to be your prisoner should import offending; <END>
which is for me less easy to commit <END>
than you to punish. <END>
not your gaoler, then, <END>
but your kind hostess. come, i'll question you <END>
of my lord's tricks and yours when you were boys: <END>
you were pretty lordings then? <END>
we were, fair queen, <END>
two lads that thought there was no more behind <END>
but such a day to-morrow as to-day, <END>
and to be boy eternal. <END>
was not my lord <END>
the verier wag o' the two? <END>
we were as twinn'd lambs that did frisk i' the sun, <END>
and bleat the one at the other: what we changed <END>
was innocence for innocence; we knew not <END>
the doctrine of ill-doing, nor dream'd <END>
that any did. had we pursued that life, <END>
and our weak spirits ne'er been higher rear'd <END>
with stronger blood, we should have answer'd heaven <END>
boldly 'not guilty;' the imposition clear'd <END>
hereditary ours. <END>
by this we gather <END>
you have tripp'd since. <END>
o my most sacred lady! <END>
temptations have since then been born to's; for <END>
in those unfledged days was my wife a girl; <END>
your precious self had then not cross'd the eyes <END>
of my young play-fellow. <END>
grace to boot! <END>
of this make no conclusion, lest you say <END>
your queen and i are devils: yet go on; <END>
the offences we have made you do we'll answer, <END>
if you first sinn'd with us and that with us <END>
you did continue fault and that you slipp'd not <END>
with any but with us. <END>
is he won yet? <END>
he'll stay my lord. <END>
at my request he would not. <END>
hermione, my dearest, thou never spokest <END>
to better purpose. <END>
never? <END>
never, but once. <END>
what! have i twice said well? when was't before? <END>
i prithee tell me; cram's with praise, and make's <END>
as fat as tame things: one good deed dying tongueless <END>
slaughters a thousand waiting upon that. <END>
our praises are our wages: you may ride's <END>
with one soft kiss a thousand furlongs ere <END>
with spur we beat an acre. but to the goal: <END>
my last good deed was to entreat his stay: <END>
what was my first? it has an elder sister, <END>
or i mistake you: o, would her name were grace! <END>
but once before i spoke to the purpose: when? <END>
nay, let me have't; i long. <END>
why, that was when <END>
three crabbed months had sour'd themselves to death, <END>
ere i could make thee open thy white hand <END>
and clap thyself my love: then didst thou utter <END>
'i am yours for ever.' <END>
'tis grace indeed. <END>
why, lo you now, i have spoke to the purpose twice: <END>
the one for ever earn'd a royal husband; <END>
the other for some while a friend. <END>
ay, my good lord. <END>
i' fecks! <END>
why, that's my bawcock. what, hast <END>
smutch'd thy nose? <END>
they say it is a copy out of mine. come, captain, <END>
we must be neat; not neat, but cleanly, captain: <END>
and yet the steer, the heifer and the calf <END>
are all call'd neat.--still virginalling <END>
upon his palm!--how now, you wanton calf! <END>
art thou my calf? <END>
yes, if you will, my lord. <END>
thou want'st a rough pash and the shoots that i have, <END>
to be full like me: yet they say we are <END>
almost as like as eggs; women say so, <END>
that will say anything but were they false <END>
as o'er-dyed blacks, as wind, as waters, false <END>
as dice are to be wish'd by one that fixes <END>
no bourn 'twixt his and mine, yet were it true <END>
to say this boy were like me. come, sir page, <END>
look on me with your welkin eye: sweet villain! <END>
most dear'st! my collop! can thy dam?--may't be?-- <END>
affection! thy intention stabs the centre: <END>
thou dost make possible things not so held, <END>
communicatest with dreams;--how can this be?-- <END>
with what's unreal thou coactive art, <END>
and fellow'st nothing: then 'tis very credent <END>
thou mayst co-join with something; and thou dost, <END>
and that beyond commission, and i find it, <END>
and that to the infection of my brains <END>
and hardening of my brows. <END>
what means sicilia? <END>
he something seems unsettled. <END>
how, my lord! <END>
what cheer? how is't with you, best brother? <END>
you look as if you held a brow of much distraction <END>
are you moved, my lord? <END>
no, in good earnest. <END>
how sometimes nature will betray its folly, <END>
its tenderness, and make itself a pastime <END>
to harder bosoms! looking on the lines <END>
of my boy's face, methoughts i did recoil <END>
twenty-three years, and saw myself unbreech'd, <END>
in my green velvet coat, my dagger muzzled, <END>
lest it should bite its master, and so prove, <END>
as ornaments oft do, too dangerous: <END>
how like, methought, i then was to this kernel, <END>
this squash, this gentleman. mine honest friend, <END>
will you take eggs for money? <END>
no, my lord, i'll fight. <END>
you will! why, happy man be's dole! my brother, <END>
are you so fond of your young prince as we <END>
do seem to be of ours? <END>
if at home, sir, <END>
he's all my exercise, my mirth, my matter, <END>
now my sworn friend and then mine enemy, <END>
my parasite, my soldier, statesman, all: <END>
he makes a july's day short as december, <END>
and with his varying childness cures in me <END>
thoughts that would thick my blood. <END>
so stands this squire <END>
officed with me: we two will walk, my lord, <END>
and leave you to your graver steps. hermione, <END>
how thou lovest us, show in our brother's welcome; <END>
let what is dear in sicily be cheap: <END>
next to thyself and my young rover, he's <END>
apparent to my heart. <END>
if you would seek us, <END>
we are yours i' the garden: shall's attend you there? <END>
to your own bents dispose you: you'll be found, <END>
be you beneath the sky. <END>
i am angling now, <END>
though you perceive me not how i give line. <END>
go to, go to! <END>
how she holds up the neb, the bill to him! <END>
and arms her with the boldness of a wife <END>
to her allowing husband! <END>
gone already! <END>
inch-thick, knee-deep, o'er head and <END>
ears a fork'd one! <END>
go, play, boy, play: thy mother plays, and i <END>
play too, but so disgraced a part, whose issue <END>
will hiss me to my grave: contempt and clamour <END>
will be my knell. go, play, boy, play. <END>
there have been, <END>
or i am much deceived, cuckolds ere now; <END>
and many a man there is, even at this present, <END>
now while i speak this, holds his wife by the arm, <END>
that little thinks she has been sluiced in's absence <END>
and his pond fish'd by his next neighbour, by <END>
sir smile, his neighbour: nay, there's comfort in't <END>
whiles other men have gates and those gates open'd, <END>
as mine, against their will. should all despair <END>
that have revolted wives, the tenth of mankind <END>
would hang themselves. physic for't there is none; <END>
it is a bawdy planet, that will strike <END>
where 'tis predominant; and 'tis powerful, think it, <END>
from east, west, north and south: be it concluded, <END>
no barricado for a belly; know't; <END>
it will let in and out the enemy <END>
with bag and baggage: many thousand on's <END>
have the disease, and feel't not. how now, boy! <END>
i am like you, they say. <END>
why that's some comfort. what, camillo there? <END>
ay, my good lord. <END>
go play, mamillius; thou'rt an honest man. <END>
camillo, this great sir will yet stay longer. <END>
you had much ado to make his anchor hold: <END>
when you cast out, it still came home. <END>
didst note it? <END>
he would not stay at your petitions: made <END>
his business more material. <END>
didst perceive it? <END>
they're here with me already, whispering, rounding <END>
'sicilia is a so-forth:' 'tis far gone, <END>
when i shall gust it last. how came't, camillo, <END>
that he did stay? <END>
at the good queen's entreaty. <END>
at the queen's be't: 'good' should be pertinent <END>
but, so it is, it is not. was this taken <END>
by any understanding pate but thine? <END>
for thy conceit is soaking, will draw in <END>
more than the common blocks: not noted, is't, <END>
but of the finer natures? by some severals <END>
of head-piece extraordinary? lower messes <END>
perchance are to this business purblind? say. <END>
business, my lord! i think most understand <END>
bohemia stays here longer. <END>
ha! <END>
stays here longer. <END>
ay, but why? <END>
to satisfy your highness and the entreaties <END>
of our most gracious mistress. <END>
satisfy! <END>
the entreaties of your mistress! satisfy! <END>
let that suffice. i have trusted thee, camillo, <END>
with all the nearest things to my heart, as well <END>
my chamber-councils, wherein, priest-like, thou <END>
hast cleansed my bosom, i from thee departed <END>
thy penitent reform'd: but we have been <END>
deceived in thy integrity, deceived <END>
in that which seems so. <END>
be it forbid, my lord! <END>
to bide upon't, thou art not honest, or, <END>
if thou inclinest that way, thou art a coward, <END>
which hoxes honesty behind, restraining <END>
from course required; or else thou must be counted <END>
a servant grafted in my serious trust <END>
and therein negligent; or else a fool <END>
that seest a game play'd home, the rich stake drawn, <END>
and takest it all for jest. <END>
my gracious lord, <END>
i may be negligent, foolish and fearful; <END>
in every one of these no man is free, <END>
but that his negligence, his folly, fear, <END>
among the infinite doings of the world, <END>
sometime puts forth. in your affairs, my lord, <END>
if ever i were wilful-negligent, <END>
it was my folly; if industriously <END>
i play'd the fool, it was my negligence, <END>
not weighing well the end; if ever fearful <END>
to do a thing, where i the issue doubted, <END>
where of the execution did cry out <END>
against the non-performance, 'twas a fear <END>
which oft infects the wisest: these, my lord, <END>
are such allow'd infirmities that honesty <END>
is never free of. but, beseech your grace, <END>
be plainer with me; let me know my trespass <END>
by its own visage: if i then deny it, <END>
'tis none of mine. <END>
ha' not you seen, camillo,-- <END>
but that's past doubt, you have, or your eye-glass <END>
is thicker than a cuckold's horn,--or heard,-- <END>
for to a vision so apparent rumour <END>
cannot be mute,--or thought,--for cogitation <END>
resides not in that man that does not think,-- <END>
my wife is slippery? if thou wilt confess, <END>
or else be impudently negative, <END>
to have nor eyes nor ears nor thought, then say <END>
my wife's a hobby-horse, deserves a name <END>
as rank as any flax-wench that puts to <END>
before her troth-plight: say't and justify't. <END>
i would not be a stander-by to hear <END>
my sovereign mistress clouded so, without <END>
my present vengeance taken: 'shrew my heart, <END>
you never spoke what did become you less <END>
than this; which to reiterate were sin <END>
as deep as that, though true. <END>
is whispering nothing? <END>
is leaning cheek to cheek? is meeting noses? <END>
kissing with inside lip? stopping the career <END>
of laughing with a sigh?--a note infallible <END>
of breaking honesty--horsing foot on foot? <END>
skulking in corners? wishing clocks more swift? <END>
hours, minutes? noon, midnight? and all eyes <END>
blind with the pin and web but theirs, theirs only, <END>
that would unseen be wicked? is this nothing? <END>
why, then the world and all that's in't is nothing; <END>
the covering sky is nothing; bohemia nothing; <END>
my wife is nothing; nor nothing have these nothings, <END>
if this be nothing. <END>
good my lord, be cured <END>
of this diseased opinion, and betimes; <END>
for 'tis most dangerous. <END>
say it be, 'tis true. <END>
no, no, my lord. <END>
it is; you lie, you lie: <END>
i say thou liest, camillo, and i hate thee, <END>
pronounce thee a gross lout, a mindless slave, <END>
or else a hovering temporizer, that <END>
canst with thine eyes at once see good and evil, <END>
inclining to them both: were my wife's liver <END>
infected as her life, she would not live <END>
the running of one glass. <END>
who does infect her? <END>
why, he that wears her like a medal, hanging <END>
about his neck, bohemia: who, if i <END>
had servants true about me, that bare eyes <END>
to see alike mine honour as their profits, <END>
their own particular thrifts, they would do that <END>
which should undo more doing: ay, and thou, <END>
his cupbearer,--whom i from meaner form <END>
have benched and reared to worship, who mayst see <END>
plainly as heaven sees earth and earth sees heaven, <END>
how i am galled,--mightst bespice a cup, <END>
to give mine enemy a lasting wink; <END>
which draught to me were cordial. <END>
sir, my lord, <END>
i could do this, and that with no rash potion, <END>
but with a lingering dram that should not work <END>
maliciously like poison: but i cannot <END>
believe this crack to be in my dread mistress, <END>
so sovereignly being honourable. <END>
i have loved thee,-- <END>
make that thy question, and go rot! <END>
dost think i am so muddy, so unsettled, <END>
to appoint myself in this vexation, sully <END>
the purity and whiteness of my sheets, <END>
which to preserve is sleep, which being spotted <END>
is goads, thorns, nettles, tails of wasps, <END>
give scandal to the blood o' the prince my son, <END>
who i do think is mine and love as mine, <END>
without ripe moving to't? would i do this? <END>
could man so blench? <END>
i must believe you, sir: <END>
i do; and will fetch off bohemia for't; <END>
provided that, when he's removed, your highness <END>
will take again your queen as yours at first, <END>
even for your son's sake; and thereby for sealing <END>
the injury of tongues in courts and kingdoms <END>
known and allied to yours. <END>
thou dost advise me <END>
even so as i mine own course have set down: <END>
i'll give no blemish to her honour, none. <END>
my lord, <END>
go then; and with a countenance as clear <END>
as friendship wears at feasts, keep with bohemia <END>
and with your queen. i am his cupbearer: <END>
if from me he have wholesome beverage, <END>
account me not your servant. <END>
this is all: <END>
do't and thou hast the one half of my heart; <END>
do't not, thou split'st thine own. <END>
i'll do't, my lord. <END>
i will seem friendly, as thou hast advised me. <END>
o miserable lady! but, for me, <END>
what case stand i in? i must be the poisoner <END>
of good polixenes; and my ground to do't <END>
is the obedience to a master, one <END>
who in rebellion with himself will have <END>
all that are his so too. to do this deed, <END>
promotion follows. if i could find example <END>
of thousands that had struck anointed kings <END>
and flourish'd after, i'ld not do't; but since <END>
nor brass nor stone nor parchment bears not one, <END>
let villany itself forswear't. i must <END>
forsake the court: to do't, or no, is certain <END>
to me a break-neck. happy star, reign now! <END>
here comes bohemia. <END>
this is strange: methinks <END>
my favour here begins to warp. not speak? <END>
good day, camillo. <END>
hail, most royal sir! <END>
what is the news i' the court? <END>
none rare, my lord. <END>
the king hath on him such a countenance <END>
as he had lost some province and a region <END>
loved as he loves himself: even now i met him <END>
with customary compliment; when he, <END>
wafting his eyes to the contrary and falling <END>
a lip of much contempt, speeds from me and <END>
so leaves me to consider what is breeding <END>
that changeth thus his manners. <END>
i dare not know, my lord. <END>
how! dare not! do not. do you know, and dare not? <END>
be intelligent to me: 'tis thereabouts; <END>
for, to yourself, what you do know, you must. <END>
and cannot say, you dare not. good camillo, <END>
your changed complexions are to me a mirror <END>
which shows me mine changed too; for i must be <END>
a party in this alteration, finding <END>
myself thus alter'd with 't. <END>
there is a sickness <END>
which puts some of us in distemper, but <END>
i cannot name the disease; and it is caught <END>
of you that yet are well. <END>
how! caught of me! <END>
make me not sighted like the basilisk: <END>
i have look'd on thousands, who have sped the better <END>
by my regard, but kill'd none so. camillo,-- <END>
as you are certainly a gentleman, thereto <END>
clerk-like experienced, which no less adorns <END>
our gentry than our parents' noble names, <END>
in whose success we are gentle,--i beseech you, <END>
if you know aught which does behove my knowledge <END>
thereof to be inform'd, imprison't not <END>
in ignorant concealment. <END>
i may not answer. <END>
a sickness caught of me, and yet i well! <END>
i must be answer'd. dost thou hear, camillo, <END>
i conjure thee, by all the parts of man <END>
which honour does acknowledge, whereof the least <END>
is not this suit of mine, that thou declare <END>
what incidency thou dost guess of harm <END>
is creeping toward me; how far off, how near; <END>
which way to be prevented, if to be; <END>
if not, how best to bear it. <END>
sir, i will tell you; <END>
since i am charged in honour and by him <END>
that i think honourable: therefore mark my counsel, <END>
which must be even as swiftly follow'd as <END>
i mean to utter it, or both yourself and me <END>
cry lost, and so good night! <END>
on, good camillo. <END>
i am appointed him to murder you. <END>
by whom, camillo? <END>
by the king. <END>
for what? <END>
he thinks, nay, with all confidence he swears, <END>
as he had seen't or been an instrument <END>
to vice you to't, that you have touch'd his queen <END>
forbiddenly. <END>
o, then my best blood turn <END>
to an infected jelly and my name <END>
be yoked with his that did betray the best! <END>
turn then my freshest reputation to <END>
a savour that may strike the dullest nostril <END>
where i arrive, and my approach be shunn'd, <END>
nay, hated too, worse than the great'st infection <END>
that e'er was heard or read! <END>
swear his thought over <END>
by each particular star in heaven and <END>
by all their influences, you may as well <END>
forbid the sea for to obey the moon <END>
as or by oath remove or counsel shake <END>
the fabric of his folly, whose foundation <END>
is piled upon his faith and will continue <END>
the standing of his body. <END>
how should this grow? <END>
i know not: but i am sure 'tis safer to <END>
avoid what's grown than question how 'tis born. <END>
if therefore you dare trust my honesty, <END>
that lies enclosed in this trunk which you <END>
shall bear along impawn'd, away to-night! <END>
your followers i will whisper to the business, <END>
and will by twos and threes at several posterns <END>
clear them o' the city. for myself, i'll put <END>
my fortunes to your service, which are here <END>
by this discovery lost. be not uncertain; <END>
for, by the honour of my parents, i <END>
have utter'd truth: which if you seek to prove, <END>
i dare not stand by; nor shall you be safer <END>
than one condemn'd by the king's own mouth, thereon <END>
his execution sworn. <END>
i do believe thee: <END>
i saw his heart in 's face. give me thy hand: <END>
be pilot to me and thy places shall <END>
still neighbour mine. my ships are ready and <END>
my people did expect my hence departure <END>
two days ago. this jealousy <END>
is for a precious creature: as she's rare, <END>
must it be great, and as his person's mighty, <END>
must it be violent, and as he does conceive <END>
he is dishonour'd by a man which ever <END>
profess'd to him, why, his revenges must <END>
in that be made more bitter. fear o'ershades me: <END>
good expedition be my friend, and comfort <END>
the gracious queen, part of his theme, but nothing <END>
of his ill-ta'en suspicion! come, camillo; <END>
i will respect thee as a father if <END>
thou bear'st my life off hence: let us avoid. <END>
it is in mine authority to command <END>
the keys of all the posterns: please your highness <END>
to take the urgent hour. come, sir, away. <END>
take the boy to you: he so troubles me, <END>
'tis past enduring. <END>
come, my gracious lord, <END>
shall i be your playfellow? <END>
no, i'll none of you. <END>
why, my sweet lord? <END>
you'll kiss me hard and speak to me as if <END>
i were a baby still. i love you better. <END>
and why so, my lord? <END>
not for because <END>
your brows are blacker; yet black brows, they say, <END>
become some women best, so that there be not <END>
too much hair there, but in a semicircle <END>
or a half-moon made with a pen. <END>
who taught you this? <END>
i learnt it out of women's faces. pray now <END>
what colour are your eyebrows? <END>
blue, my lord. <END>
nay, that's a mock: i have seen a lady's nose <END>
that has been blue, but not her eyebrows. <END>
hark ye; <END>
the queen your mother rounds apace: we shall <END>
present our services to a fine new prince <END>
one of these days; and then you'ld wanton with us, <END>
if we would have you. <END>
she is spread of late <END>
into a goodly bulk: good time encounter her! <END>
what wisdom stirs amongst you? come, sir, now <END>
i am for you again: pray you, sit by us, <END>
and tell 's a tale. <END>
merry or sad shall't be? <END>
as merry as you will. <END>
a sad tale's best for winter: i have one <END>
of sprites and goblins. <END>
let's have that, good sir. <END>
come on, sit down: come on, and do your best <END>
to fright me with your sprites; you're powerful at it. <END>
there was a man-- <END>
nay, come, sit down; then on. <END>
dwelt by a churchyard: i will tell it softly; <END>
yond crickets shall not hear it. <END>
come on, then, <END>
and give't me in mine ear. <END>
was he met there? his train? camillo with him? <END>
behind the tuft of pines i met them; never <END>
saw i men scour so on their way: i eyed them <END>
even to their ships. <END>
how blest am i <END>
in my just censure, in my true opinion! <END>
alack, for lesser knowledge! how accursed <END>
in being so blest! there may be in the cup <END>
a spider steep'd, and one may drink, depart, <END>
and yet partake no venom, for his knowledge <END>
is not infected: but if one present <END>
the abhorr'd ingredient to his eye, make known <END>
how he hath drunk, he cracks his gorge, his sides, <END>
with violent hefts. i have drunk, <END>
and seen the spider. <END>
camillo was his help in this, his pander: <END>
there is a plot against my life, my crown; <END>
all's true that is mistrusted: that false villain <END>
whom i employ'd was pre-employ'd by him: <END>
he has discover'd my design, and i <END>
remain a pinch'd thing; yea, a very trick <END>
for them to play at will. how came the posterns <END>
so easily open? <END>
by his great authority; <END>
which often hath no less prevail'd than so <END>
on your command. <END>
i know't too well. <END>
give me the boy: i am glad you did not nurse him: <END>
though he does bear some signs of me, yet you <END>
have too much blood in him. <END>
what is this? sport? <END>
bear the boy hence; he shall not come about her; <END>
away with him! and let her sport herself <END>
with that she's big with; for 'tis polixenes <END>
has made thee swell thus. <END>
but i'ld say he had not, <END>
and i'll be sworn you would believe my saying, <END>
howe'er you lean to the nayward. <END>
you, my lords, <END>
look on her, mark her well; be but about <END>
to say 'she is a goodly lady,' and <END>
the justice of your bearts will thereto add <END>
'tis pity she's not honest, honourable:' <END>
praise her but for this her without-door form, <END>
which on my faith deserves high speech, and straight <END>
the shrug, the hum or ha, these petty brands <END>
that calumny doth use--o, i am out-- <END>
that mercy does, for calumny will sear <END>
virtue itself: these shrugs, these hums and ha's, <END>
when you have said 'she's goodly,' come between <END>
ere you can say 'she's honest:' but be 't known, <END>
from him that has most cause to grieve it should be, <END>
she's an adulteress. <END>
should a villain say so, <END>
the most replenish'd villain in the world, <END>
he were as much more villain: you, my lord, <END>
do but mistake. <END>
you have mistook, my lady, <END>
polixenes for leontes: o thou thing! <END>
which i'll not call a creature of thy place, <END>
lest barbarism, making me the precedent, <END>
should a like language use to all degrees <END>
and mannerly distinguishment leave out <END>
betwixt the prince and beggar: i have said <END>
she's an adulteress; i have said with whom: <END>
more, she's a traitor and camillo is <END>
a federary with her, and one that knows <END>
what she should shame to know herself <END>
but with her most vile principal, that she's <END>
a bed-swerver, even as bad as those <END>
that vulgars give bold'st titles, ay, and privy <END>
to this their late escape. <END>
no, by my life. <END>
privy to none of this. how will this grieve you, <END>
when you shall come to clearer knowledge, that <END>
you thus have publish'd me! gentle my lord, <END>
you scarce can right me throughly then to say <END>
you did mistake. <END>
no; if i mistake <END>
in those foundations which i build upon, <END>
the centre is not big enough to bear <END>
a school-boy's top. away with her! to prison! <END>
he who shall speak for her is afar off guilty <END>
but that he speaks. <END>
there's some ill planet reigns: <END>
i must be patient till the heavens look <END>
with an aspect more favourable. good my lords, <END>
i am not prone to weeping, as our sex <END>
commonly are; the want of which vain dew <END>
perchance shall dry your pities: but i have <END>
that honourable grief lodged here which burns <END>
worse than tears drown: beseech you all, my lords, <END>
with thoughts so qualified as your charities <END>
shall best instruct you, measure me; and so <END>
the king's will be perform'd! <END>
shall i be heard? <END>
who is't that goes with me? beseech your highness, <END>
my women may be with me; for you see <END>
my plight requires it. do not weep, good fools; <END>
there is no cause: when you shall know your mistress <END>
has deserved prison, then abound in tears <END>
as i come out: this action i now go on <END>
is for my better grace. adieu, my lord: <END>
i never wish'd to see you sorry; now <END>
i trust i shall. my women, come; you have leave. <END>
go, do our bidding; hence! <END>
beseech your highness, call the queen again. <END>
be certain what you do, sir, lest your justice <END>
prove violence; in the which three great ones suffer, <END>
yourself, your queen, your son. <END>
for her, my lord, <END>
i dare my life lay down and will do't, sir, <END>
please you to accept it, that the queen is spotless <END>
i' the eyes of heaven and to you; i mean, <END>
in this which you accuse her. <END>
if it prove <END>
she's otherwise, i'll keep my stables where <END>
i lodge my wife; i'll go in couples with her; <END>
than when i feel and see her no farther trust her; <END>
for every inch of woman in the world, <END>
ay, every dram of woman's flesh is false, if she be. <END>
hold your peaces. <END>
good my lord,-- <END>
it is for you we speak, not for ourselves: <END>
you are abused and by some putter-on <END>
that will be damn'd for't; would i knew the villain, <END>
i would land-damn him. be she honour-flaw'd, <END>
i have three daughters; the eldest is eleven <END>
the second and the third, nine, and some five; <END>
if this prove true, they'll pay for't: <END>
by mine honour, <END>
i'll geld 'em all; fourteen they shall not see, <END>
to bring false generations: they are co-heirs; <END>
and i had rather glib myself than they <END>
should not produce fair issue. <END>
cease; no more. <END>
you smell this business with a sense as cold <END>
as is a dead man's nose: but i do see't and feel't <END>
as you feel doing thus; and see withal <END>
the instruments that feel. <END>
if it be so, <END>
we need no grave to bury honesty: <END>
there's not a grain of it the face to sweeten <END>
of the whole dungy earth. <END>
what! lack i credit? <END>
i had rather you did lack than i, my lord, <END>
upon this ground; and more it would content me <END>
to have her honour true than your suspicion, <END>
be blamed for't how you might. <END>
why, what need we <END>
commune with you of this, but rather follow <END>
our forceful instigation? our prerogative <END>
calls not your counsels, but our natural goodness <END>
imparts this; which if you, or stupefied <END>
or seeming so in skill, cannot or will not <END>
relish a truth like us, inform yourselves <END>
we need no more of your advice: the matter, <END>
the loss, the gain, the ordering on't, is all <END>
properly ours. <END>
and i wish, my liege, <END>
you had only in your silent judgment tried it, <END>
without more overture. <END>
how could that be? <END>
either thou art most ignorant by age, <END>
or thou wert born a fool. camillo's flight, <END>
added to their familiarity, <END>
which was as gross as ever touch'd conjecture, <END>
that lack'd sight only, nought for approbation <END>
but only seeing, all other circumstances <END>
made up to the deed, doth push on this proceeding: <END>
yet, for a greater confirmation, <END>
for in an act of this importance 'twere <END>
most piteous to be wild, i have dispatch'd in post <END>
to sacred delphos, to apollo's temple, <END>
cleomenes and dion, whom you know <END>
of stuff'd sufficiency: now from the oracle <END>
they will bring all; whose spiritual counsel had, <END>
shall stop or spur me. have i done well? <END>
well done, my lord. <END>
though i am satisfied and need no more <END>
than what i know, yet shall the oracle <END>
give rest to the minds of others, such as he <END>
whose ignorant credulity will not <END>
come up to the truth. so have we thought it good <END>
from our free person she should be confined, <END>
lest that the treachery of the two fled hence <END>
be left her to perform. come, follow us; <END>
we are to speak in public; for this business <END>
will raise us all. <END>
the keeper of the prison, call to him; <END>
let him have knowledge who i am. <END>
good lady, <END>
no court in europe is too good for thee; <END>
what dost thou then in prison? <END>
now, good sir, <END>
you know me, do you not? <END>
for a worthy lady <END>
and one whom much i honour. <END>
pray you then, <END>
conduct me to the queen. <END>
i may not, madam: <END>
to the contrary i have express commandment. <END>
here's ado, <END>
to lock up honesty and honour from <END>
the access of gentle visitors! <END>
is't lawful, pray you, <END>
to see her women? any of them? emilia? <END>
so please you, madam, <END>
to put apart these your attendants, i <END>
shall bring emilia forth. <END>
i pray now, call her. <END>
withdraw yourselves. <END>
and, madam, <END>
i must be present at your conference. <END>
well, be't so, prithee. <END>
here's such ado to make no stain a stain <END>
as passes colouring. <END>
dear gentlewoman, <END>
how fares our gracious lady? <END>
as well as one so great and so forlorn <END>
may hold together: on her frights and griefs, <END>
which never tender lady hath born greater, <END>
she is something before her time deliver'd. <END>
a boy? <END>
a daughter, and a goodly babe, <END>
lusty and like to live: the queen receives <END>
much comfort in't; says 'my poor prisoner, <END>
i am innocent as you.' <END>
i dare be sworn <END>
these dangerous unsafe lunes i' the king, <END>
beshrew them! <END>
he must be told on't, and he shall: the office <END>
becomes a woman best; i'll take't upon me: <END>
if i prove honey-mouth'd let my tongue blister <END>
and never to my red-look'd anger be <END>
the trumpet any more. pray you, emilia, <END>
commend my best obedience to the queen: <END>
if she dares trust me with her little babe, <END>
i'll show't the king and undertake to be <END>
her advocate to the loud'st. we do not know <END>
how he may soften at the sight o' the child: <END>
the silence often of pure innocence <END>
persuades when speaking fails. <END>
most worthy madam, <END>
your honour and your goodness is so evident <END>
that your free undertaking cannot miss <END>
a thriving issue: there is no lady living <END>
so meet for this great errand. please your ladyship <END>
to visit the next room, i'll presently <END>
acquaint the queen of your most noble offer; <END>
who but to-day hammer'd of this design, <END>
but durst not tempt a minister of honour, <END>
lest she should be denied. <END>
tell her, emilia. <END>
i'll use that tongue i have: if wit flow from't <END>
as boldness from my bosom, let 't not be doubted <END>
i shall do good. <END>
now be you blest for it! <END>
i'll to the queen: please you, <END>
come something nearer. <END>
madam, if't please the queen to send the babe, <END>
i know not what i shall incur to pass it, <END>
having no warrant. <END>
you need not fear it, sir: <END>
this child was prisoner to the womb and is <END>
by law and process of great nature thence <END>
freed and enfranchised, not a party to <END>
the anger of the king nor guilty of, <END>
if any be, the trespass of the queen. <END>
i do believe it. <END>
do not you fear: upon mine honour, <END>
i will stand betwixt you and danger. <END>
nor night nor day no rest: it is but weakness <END>
to bear the matter thus; mere weakness. if <END>
the cause were not in being,--part o' the cause, <END>
she the adulteress; for the harlot king <END>
is quite beyond mine arm, out of the blank <END>
and level of my brain, plot-proof; but she <END>
i can hook to me: say that she were gone, <END>
given to the fire, a moiety of my rest <END>
might come to me again. who's there? <END>
my lord? <END>
how does the boy? <END>
he took good rest to-night; <END>
'tis hoped his sickness is discharged. <END>
to see his nobleness! <END>
conceiving the dishonour of his mother, <END>
he straight declined, droop'd, took it deeply, <END>
fasten'd and fix'd the shame on't in himself, <END>
threw off his spirit, his appetite, his sleep, <END>
and downright languish'd. leave me solely: go, <END>
see how he fares. <END>
fie, fie! no thought of him: <END>
the thought of my revenges that way <END>
recoil upon me: in himself too mighty, <END>
and in his parties, his alliance; let him be <END>
until a time may serve: for present vengeance, <END>
take it on her. camillo and polixenes <END>
laugh at me, make their pastime at my sorrow: <END>
they should not laugh if i could reach them, nor <END>
shall she within my power. <END>
you must not enter. <END>
nay, rather, good my lords, be second to me: <END>
fear you his tyrannous passion more, alas, <END>
than the queen's life? a gracious innocent soul, <END>
more free than he is jealous. <END>
that's enough. <END>
madam, he hath not slept tonight; commanded <END>
none should come at him. <END>
not so hot, good sir: <END>
i come to bring him sleep. 'tis such as you, <END>
that creep like shadows by him and do sigh <END>
at each his needless heavings, such as you <END>
nourish the cause of his awaking: i <END>
do come with words as medicinal as true, <END>
honest as either, to purge him of that humour <END>
that presses him from sleep. <END>
what noise there, ho? <END>
no noise, my lord; but needful conference <END>
about some gossips for your highness. <END>
how! <END>
away with that audacious lady! antigonus, <END>
i charged thee that she should not come about me: <END>
i knew she would. <END>
i told her so, my lord, <END>
on your displeasure's peril and on mine, <END>
she should not visit you. <END>
what, canst not rule her? <END>
from all dishonesty he can: in this, <END>
unless he take the course that you have done, <END>
commit me for committing honour, trust it, <END>
he shall not rule me. <END>
la you now, you hear: <END>
when she will take the rein i let her run; <END>
but she'll not stumble. <END>
good my liege, i come; <END>
and, i beseech you, hear me, who profess <END>
myself your loyal servant, your physician, <END>
your most obedient counsellor, yet that dare <END>
less appear so in comforting your evils, <END>
than such as most seem yours: i say, i come <END>
from your good queen. <END>
good queen! <END>
good queen, my lord, <END>
good queen; i say good queen; <END>
and would by combat make her good, so were i <END>
a man, the worst about you. <END>
force her hence. <END>
let him that makes but trifles of his eyes <END>
first hand me: on mine own accord i'll off; <END>
but first i'll do my errand. the good queen, <END>
for she is good, hath brought you forth a daughter; <END>
here 'tis; commends it to your blessing. <END>
out! <END>
a mankind witch! hence with her, out o' door: <END>
a most intelligencing bawd! <END>
not so: <END>
i am as ignorant in that as you <END>
in so entitling me, and no less honest <END>
than you are mad; which is enough, i'll warrant, <END>
as this world goes, to pass for honest. <END>
traitors! <END>
will you not push her out? give her the bastard. <END>
thou dotard! thou art woman-tired, unroosted <END>
by thy dame partlet here. take up the bastard; <END>
take't up, i say; give't to thy crone. <END>
for ever <END>
unvenerable be thy hands, if thou <END>
takest up the princess by that forced baseness <END>
which he has put upon't! <END>
he dreads his wife. <END>
so i would you did; then 'twere past all doubt <END>
you'ld call your children yours. <END>
a nest of traitors! <END>
i am none, by this good light. <END>
nor i, nor any <END>
but one that's here, and that's himself, for he <END>
the sacred honour of himself, his queen's, <END>
his hopeful son's, his babe's, betrays to slander, <END>
whose sting is sharper than the sword's; <END>
and will not-- <END>
for, as the case now stands, it is a curse <END>
he cannot be compell'd to't--once remove <END>
the root of his opinion, which is rotten <END>
as ever oak or stone was sound. <END>
a callat <END>
of boundless tongue, who late hath beat her husband <END>
and now baits me! this brat is none of mine; <END>
it is the issue of polixenes: <END>
hence with it, and together with the dam <END>
commit them to the fire! <END>
it is yours; <END>
and, might we lay the old proverb to your charge, <END>
so like you, 'tis the worse. behold, my lords, <END>
although the print be little, the whole matter <END>
and copy of the father, eye, nose, lip, <END>
the trick of's frown, his forehead, nay, the valley, <END>
the pretty dimples of his chin and cheek, <END>
his smiles, <END>
the very mould and frame of hand, nail, finger: <END>
and thou, good goddess nature, which hast made it <END>
so like to him that got it, if thou hast <END>
the ordering of the mind too, 'mongst all colours <END>
no yellow in't, lest she suspect, as he does, <END>
her children not her husband's! <END>
a gross hag <END>
and, lozel, thou art worthy to be hang'd, <END>
that wilt not stay her tongue. <END>
hang all the husbands <END>
that cannot do that feat, you'll leave yourself <END>
hardly one subject. <END>
once more, take her hence. <END>
a most unworthy and unnatural lord <END>
can do no more. <END>
i'll ha' thee burnt. <END>
i care not: <END>
it is an heretic that makes the fire, <END>
not she which burns in't. i'll not call you tyrant; <END>
but this most cruel usage of your queen, <END>
not able to produce more accusation <END>
than your own weak-hinged fancy, something savours <END>
of tyranny and will ignoble make you, <END>
yea, scandalous to the world. <END>
on your allegiance, <END>
out of the chamber with her! were i a tyrant, <END>
where were her life? she durst not call me so, <END>
if she did know me one. away with her! <END>
i pray you, do not push me; i'll be gone. <END>
look to your babe, my lord; 'tis yours: <END>
jove send her <END>
a better guiding spirit! what needs these hands? <END>
you, that are thus so tender o'er his follies, <END>
will never do him good, not one of you. <END>
so, so: farewell; we are gone. <END>
thou, traitor, hast set on thy wife to this. <END>
my child? away with't! even thou, that hast <END>
a heart so tender o'er it, take it hence <END>
and see it instantly consumed with fire; <END>
even thou and none but thou. take it up straight: <END>
within this hour bring me word 'tis done, <END>
and by good testimony, or i'll seize thy life, <END>
with what thou else call'st thine. if thou refuse <END>
and wilt encounter with my wrath, say so; <END>
the bastard brains with these my proper hands <END>
shall i dash out. go, take it to the fire; <END>
for thou set'st on thy wife. <END>
i did not, sir: <END>
these lords, my noble fellows, if they please, <END>
can clear me in't. <END>
we can: my royal liege, <END>
he is not guilty of her coming hither. <END>
you're liars all. <END>
beseech your highness, give us better credit: <END>
we have always truly served you, and beseech you <END>
so to esteem of us, and on our knees we beg, <END>
as recompense of our dear services <END>
past and to come, that you do change this purpose, <END>
which being so horrible, so bloody, must <END>
lead on to some foul issue: we all kneel. <END>
i am a feather for each wind that blows: <END>
shall i live on to see this bastard kneel <END>
and call me father? better burn it now <END>
than curse it then. but be it; let it live. <END>
it shall not neither. you, sir, come you hither; <END>
you that have been so tenderly officious <END>
with lady margery, your midwife there, <END>
to save this bastard's life,--for 'tis a bastard, <END>
so sure as this beard's grey, <END>
--what will you adventure <END>
to save this brat's life? <END>
any thing, my lord, <END>
that my ability may undergo <END>
and nobleness impose: at least thus much: <END>
i'll pawn the little blood which i have left <END>
to save the innocent: any thing possible. <END>
it shall be possible. swear by this sword <END>
thou wilt perform my bidding. <END>
i will, my lord. <END>
mark and perform it, see'st thou! for the fail <END>
of any point in't shall not only be <END>
death to thyself but to thy lewd-tongued wife, <END>
whom for this time we pardon. we enjoin thee, <END>
as thou art liege-man to us, that thou carry <END>
this female bastard hence and that thou bear it <END>
to some remote and desert place quite out <END>
of our dominions, and that there thou leave it, <END>
without more mercy, to its own protection <END>
and favour of the climate. as by strange fortune <END>
it came to us, i do in justice charge thee, <END>
on thy soul's peril and thy body's torture, <END>
that thou commend it strangely to some place <END>
where chance may nurse or end it. take it up. <END>
i swear to do this, though a present death <END>
had been more merciful. come on, poor babe: <END>
some powerful spirit instruct the kites and ravens <END>
to be thy nurses! wolves and bears, they say <END>
casting their savageness aside have done <END>
like offices of pity. sir, be prosperous <END>
in more than this deed does require! and blessing <END>
against this cruelty fight on thy side, <END>
poor thing, condemn'd to loss! <END>
no, i'll not rear <END>
another's issue. <END>
please your highness, posts <END>
from those you sent to the oracle are come <END>
an hour since: cleomenes and dion, <END>
being well arrived from delphos, are both landed, <END>
hasting to the court. <END>
so please you, sir, their speed <END>
hath been beyond account. <END>
twenty-three days <END>
they have been absent: 'tis good speed; foretells <END>
the great apollo suddenly will have <END>
the truth of this appear. prepare you, lords; <END>
summon a session, that we may arraign <END>
our most disloyal lady, for, as she hath <END>
been publicly accused, so shall she have <END>
a just and open trial. while she lives <END>
my heart will be a burthen to me. leave me, <END>
and think upon my bidding. <END>
the climate's delicate, the air most sweet, <END>
fertile the isle, the temple much surpassing <END>
the common praise it bears. <END>
i shall report, <END>
for most it caught me, the celestial habits, <END>
methinks i so should term them, and the reverence <END>
of the grave wearers. o, the sacrifice! <END>
how ceremonious, solemn and unearthly <END>
it was i' the offering! <END>
but of all, the burst <END>
and the ear-deafening voice o' the oracle, <END>
kin to jove's thunder, so surprised my sense. <END>
that i was nothing. <END>
if the event o' the journey <END>
prove as successful to the queen,--o be't so!-- <END>
as it hath been to us rare, pleasant, speedy, <END>
the time is worth the use on't. <END>
great apollo <END>
turn all to the best! these proclamations, <END>
so forcing faults upon hermione, <END>
i little like. <END>
the violent carriage of it <END>
will clear or end the business: when the oracle, <END>
thus by apollo's great divine seal'd up, <END>
shall the contents discover, something rare <END>
even then will rush to knowledge. go: fresh horses! <END>
and gracious be the issue! <END>
this sessions, to our great grief we pronounce, <END>
even pushes 'gainst our heart: the party tried <END>
the daughter of a king, our wife, and one <END>
of us too much beloved. let us be clear'd <END>
of being tyrannous, since we so openly <END>
proceed in justice, which shall have due course, <END>
even to the guilt or the purgation. <END>
produce the prisoner. <END>
it is his highness' pleasure that the queen <END>
appear in person here in court. silence! <END>
read the indictment. <END>
since what i am to say must be but that <END>
which contradicts my accusation and <END>
the testimony on my part no other <END>
but what comes from myself, it shall scarce boot me <END>
to say 'not guilty:' mine integrity <END>
being counted falsehood, shall, as i express it, <END>
be so received. but thus: if powers divine <END>
behold our human actions, as they do, <END>
i doubt not then but innocence shall make <END>
false accusation blush and tyranny <END>
tremble at patience. you, my lord, best know, <END>
who least will seem to do so, my past life <END>
hath been as continent, as chaste, as true, <END>
as i am now unhappy; which is more <END>
than history can pattern, though devised <END>
and play'd to take spectators. for behold me <END>
a fellow of the royal bed, which owe <END>
a moiety of the throne a great king's daughter, <END>
the mother to a hopeful prince, here standing <END>
to prate and talk for life and honour 'fore <END>
who please to come and hear. for life, i prize it <END>
as i weigh grief, which i would spare: for honour, <END>
'tis a derivative from me to mine, <END>
and only that i stand for. i appeal <END>
to your own conscience, sir, before polixenes <END>
came to your court, how i was in your grace, <END>
how merited to be so; since he came, <END>
with what encounter so uncurrent i <END>
have strain'd to appear thus: if one jot beyond <END>
the bound of honour, or in act or will <END>
that way inclining, harden'd be the hearts <END>
of all that hear me, and my near'st of kin <END>
cry fie upon my grave! <END>
i ne'er heard yet <END>
that any of these bolder vices wanted <END>
less impudence to gainsay what they did <END>
than to perform it first. <END>
that's true enough; <END>
through 'tis a saying, sir, not due to me. <END>
you will not own it. <END>
more than mistress of <END>
which comes to me in name of fault, i must not <END>
at all acknowledge. for polixenes, <END>
with whom i am accused, i do confess <END>
i loved him as in honour he required, <END>
with such a kind of love as might become <END>
a lady like me, with a love even such, <END>
so and no other, as yourself commanded: <END>
which not to have done i think had been in me <END>
both disobedience and ingratitude <END>
to you and toward your friend, whose love had spoke, <END>
even since it could speak, from an infant, freely <END>
that it was yours. now, for conspiracy, <END>
i know not how it tastes; though it be dish'd <END>
for me to try how: all i know of it <END>
is that camillo was an honest man; <END>
and why he left your court, the gods themselves, <END>
wotting no more than i, are ignorant. <END>
you knew of his departure, as you know <END>
what you have underta'en to do in's absence. <END>
sir, <END>
you speak a language that i understand not: <END>
my life stands in the level of your dreams, <END>
which i'll lay down. <END>
your actions are my dreams; <END>
you had a bastard by polixenes, <END>
and i but dream'd it. as you were past all shame,-- <END>
those of your fact are so--so past all truth: <END>
which to deny concerns more than avails; for as <END>
thy brat hath been cast out, like to itself, <END>
no father owning it,--which is, indeed, <END>
more criminal in thee than it,--so thou <END>
shalt feel our justice, in whose easiest passage <END>
look for no less than death. <END>
sir, spare your threats: <END>
the bug which you would fright me with i seek. <END>
to me can life be no commodity: <END>
the crown and comfort of my life, your favour, <END>
i do give lost; for i do feel it gone, <END>
but know not how it went. my second joy <END>
and first-fruits of my body, from his presence <END>
i am barr'd, like one infectious. my third comfort <END>
starr'd most unluckily, is from my breast, <END>
the innocent milk in its most innocent mouth, <END>
haled out to murder: myself on every post <END>
proclaimed a strumpet: with immodest hatred <END>
the child-bed privilege denied, which 'longs <END>
to women of all fashion; lastly, hurried <END>
here to this place, i' the open air, before <END>
i have got strength of limit. now, my liege, <END>
tell me what blessings i have here alive, <END>
that i should fear to die? therefore proceed. <END>
but yet hear this: mistake me not; no life, <END>
i prize it not a straw, but for mine honour, <END>
which i would free, if i shall be condemn'd <END>
upon surmises, all proofs sleeping else <END>
but what your jealousies awake, i tell you <END>
'tis rigor and not law. your honours all, <END>
i do refer me to the oracle: <END>
apollo be my judge! <END>
this your request <END>
is altogether just: therefore bring forth, <END>
and in apollos name, his oracle. <END>
the emperor of russia was my father: <END>
o that he were alive, and here beholding <END>
his daughter's trial! that he did but see <END>
the flatness of my misery, yet with eyes <END>
of pity, not revenge! <END>
you here shall swear upon this sword of justice, <END>
that you, cleomenes and dion, have <END>
been both at delphos, and from thence have brought <END>
the seal'd-up oracle, by the hand deliver'd <END>
of great apollo's priest; and that, since then, <END>
you have not dared to break the holy seal <END>
nor read the secrets in't. <END>
all this we swear. <END>
break up the seals and read. <END>
now blessed be the great apollo! <END>
praised! <END>
hast thou read truth? <END>
ay, my lord; even so <END>
as it is here set down. <END>
there is no truth at all i' the oracle: <END>
the sessions shall proceed: this is mere falsehood. <END>
my lord the king, the king! <END>
what is the business? <END>
o sir, i shall be hated to report it! <END>
the prince your son, with mere conceit and fear <END>
of the queen's speed, is gone. <END>
how! gone! <END>
is dead. <END>
apollo's angry; and the heavens themselves <END>
do strike at my injustice. <END>
how now there! <END>
this news is mortal to the queen: look down <END>
and see what death is doing. <END>
take her hence: <END>
her heart is but o'ercharged; she will recover: <END>
i have too much believed mine own suspicion: <END>
beseech you, tenderly apply to her <END>
some remedies for life. <END>
apollo, pardon <END>
my great profaneness 'gainst thine oracle! <END>
i'll reconcile me to polixenes, <END>
new woo my queen, recall the good camillo, <END>
whom i proclaim a man of truth, of mercy; <END>
for, being transported by my jealousies <END>
to bloody thoughts and to revenge, i chose <END>
camillo for the minister to poison <END>
my friend polixenes: which had been done, <END>
but that the good mind of camillo tardied <END>
my swift command, though i with death and with <END>
reward did threaten and encourage him, <END>
not doing 't and being done: he, most humane <END>
and fill'd with honour, to my kingly guest <END>
unclasp'd my practise, quit his fortunes here, <END>
which you knew great, and to the hazard <END>
of all encertainties himself commended, <END>
no richer than his honour: how he glisters <END>
thorough my rust! and how his pity <END>
does my deeds make the blacker! <END>
woe the while! <END>
o, cut my lace, lest my heart, cracking it, <END>
break too. <END>
what fit is this, good lady? <END>
what studied torments, tyrant, hast for me? <END>
what wheels? racks? fires? what flaying? boiling? <END>
in leads or oils? what old or newer torture <END>
must i receive, whose every word deserves <END>
to taste of thy most worst? thy tyranny <END>
together working with thy jealousies, <END>
fancies too weak for boys, too green and idle <END>
for girls of nine, o, think what they have done <END>
and then run mad indeed, stark mad! for all <END>
thy by-gone fooleries were but spices of it. <END>
that thou betray'dst polixenes,'twas nothing; <END>
that did but show thee, of a fool, inconstant <END>
and damnable ingrateful: nor was't much, <END>
thou wouldst have poison'd good camillo's honour, <END>
to have him kill a king: poor trespasses, <END>
more monstrous standing by: whereof i reckon <END>
the casting forth to crows thy baby-daughter <END>
to be or none or little; though a devil <END>
would have shed water out of fire ere done't: <END>
nor is't directly laid to thee, the death <END>
of the young prince, whose honourable thoughts, <END>
thoughts high for one so tender, cleft the heart <END>
that could conceive a gross and foolish sire <END>
blemish'd his gracious dam: this is not, no, <END>
laid to thy answer: but the last,--o lords, <END>
when i have said, cry 'woe!' the queen, the queen, <END>
the sweet'st, dear'st creature's dead, <END>
and vengeance for't <END>
not dropp'd down yet. <END>
the higher powers forbid! <END>
i say she's dead; i'll swear't. if word nor oath <END>
prevail not, go and see: if you can bring <END>
tincture or lustre in her lip, her eye, <END>
heat outwardly or breath within, i'll serve you <END>
as i would do the gods. but, o thou tyrant! <END>
do not repent these things, for they are heavier <END>
than all thy woes can stir; therefore betake thee <END>
to nothing but despair. a thousand knees <END>
ten thousand years together, naked, fasting, <END>
upon a barren mountain and still winter <END>
in storm perpetual, could not move the gods <END>
to look that way thou wert. <END>
go on, go on <END>
thou canst not speak too much; i have deserved <END>
all tongues to talk their bitterest. <END>
say no more: <END>
howe'er the business goes, you have made fault <END>
i' the boldness of your speech. <END>
i am sorry for't: <END>
all faults i make, when i shall come to know them, <END>
i do repent. alas! i have show'd too much <END>
the rashness of a woman: he is touch'd <END>
to the noble heart. what's gone and what's past help <END>
should be past grief: do not receive affliction <END>
at my petition; i beseech you, rather <END>
let me be punish'd, that have minded you <END>
of what you should forget. now, good my liege <END>
sir, royal sir, forgive a foolish woman: <END>
the love i bore your queen--lo, fool again!-- <END>
i'll speak of her no more, nor of your children; <END>
i'll not remember you of my own lord, <END>
who is lost too: take your patience to you, <END>
and i'll say nothing. <END>
thou didst speak but well <END>
when most the truth; which i receive much better <END>
than to be pitied of thee. prithee, bring me <END>
to the dead bodies of my queen and son: <END>
one grave shall be for both: upon them shall <END>
the causes of their death appear, unto <END>
our shame perpetual. once a day i'll visit <END>
the chapel where they lie, and tears shed there <END>
shall be my recreation: so long as nature <END>
will bear up with this exercise, so long <END>
i daily vow to use it. come and lead me <END>
unto these sorrows. <END>
thou art perfect then, our ship hath touch'd upon <END>
the deserts of bohemia? <END>
ay, my lord: and fear <END>
we have landed in ill time: the skies look grimly <END>
and threaten present blusters. in my conscience, <END>
the heavens with that we have in hand are angry <END>
and frown upon 's. <END>
their sacred wills be done! go, get aboard; <END>
look to thy bark: i'll not be long before <END>
i call upon thee. <END>
make your best haste, and go not <END>
too far i' the land: 'tis like to be loud weather; <END>
besides, this place is famous for the creatures <END>
of prey that keep upon't. <END>
go thou away: <END>
i'll follow instantly. <END>
i am glad at heart <END>
to be so rid o' the business. <END>
come, poor babe: <END>
i have heard, but not believed, <END>
the spirits o' the dead <END>
may walk again: if such thing be, thy mother <END>
appear'd to me last night, for ne'er was dream <END>
so like a waking. to me comes a creature, <END>
sometimes her head on one side, some another; <END>
i never saw a vessel of like sorrow, <END>
so fill'd and so becoming: in pure white robes, <END>
like very sanctity, she did approach <END>
my cabin where i lay; thrice bow'd before me, <END>
and gasping to begin some speech, her eyes <END>
became two spouts: the fury spent, anon <END>
did this break-from her: 'good antigonus, <END>
since fate, against thy better disposition, <END>
hath made thy person for the thrower-out <END>
of my poor babe, according to thine oath, <END>
places remote enough are in bohemia, <END>
there weep and leave it crying; and, for the babe <END>
is counted lost for ever, perdita, <END>
i prithee, call't. for this ungentle business <END>
put on thee by my lord, thou ne'er shalt see <END>
thy wife paulina more.' and so, with shrieks <END>
she melted into air. affrighted much, <END>
i did in time collect myself and thought <END>
this was so and no slumber. dreams are toys: <END>
yet for this once, yea, superstitiously, <END>
i will be squared by this. i do believe <END>
hermione hath suffer'd death, and that <END>
apollo would, this being indeed the issue <END>
of king polixenes, it should here be laid, <END>
either for life or death, upon the earth <END>
of its right father. blossom, speed thee well! <END>
there lie, and there thy character: there these; <END>
which may, if fortune please, both breed thee, pretty, <END>
and still rest thine. the storm begins; poor wretch, <END>
that for thy mother's fault art thus exposed <END>
to loss and what may follow! weep i cannot, <END>
but my heart bleeds; and most accursed am i <END>
to be by oath enjoin'd to this. farewell! <END>
the day frowns more and more: thou'rt like to have <END>
a lullaby too rough: i never saw <END>
the heavens so dim by day. a savage clamour! <END>
well may i get aboard! this is the chase: <END>
i am gone for ever. <END>
i would there were no age between sixteen and <END>
three-and-twenty, or that youth would sleep out the <END>
rest; for there is nothing in the between but <END>
getting wenches with child, wronging the ancientry, <END>
stealing, fighting--hark you now! would any but <END>
these boiled brains of nineteen and two-and-twenty <END>
hunt this weather? they have scared away two of my <END>
best sheep, which i fear the wolf will sooner find <END>
than the master: if any where i have them, 'tis by <END>
the seaside, browsing of ivy. good luck, an't be thy <END>
will what have we here! mercy on 's, a barne a very <END>
pretty barne! a boy or a child, i wonder? a <END>
pretty one; a very pretty one: sure, some 'scape: <END>
though i am not bookish, yet i can read <END>
waiting-gentlewoman in the 'scape. this has been <END>
some stair-work, some trunk-work, some <END>
behind-door-work: they were warmer that got this <END>
than the poor thing is here. i'll take it up for <END>
pity: yet i'll tarry till my son come; he hallooed <END>
but even now. whoa, ho, hoa! <END>
hilloa, loa! <END>
what, art so near? if thou'lt see a thing to talk <END>
on when thou art dead and rotten, come hither. what <END>
ailest thou, man? <END>
i have seen two such sights, by sea and by land! <END>
but i am not to say it is a sea, for it is now the <END>
sky: betwixt the firmament and it you cannot thrust <END>
a bodkin's point. <END>
why, boy, how is it? <END>
i would you did but see how it chafes, how it rages, <END>
how it takes up the shore! but that's not the <END>
point. o, the most piteous cry of the poor souls! <END>
sometimes to see 'em, and not to see 'em; now the <END>
ship boring the moon with her main-mast, and anon <END>
swallowed with yest and froth, as you'ld thrust a <END>
cork into a hogshead. and then for the <END>
land-service, to see how the bear tore out his <END>
shoulder-bone; how he cried to me for help and said <END>
his name was antigonus, a nobleman. but to make an <END>
end of the ship, to see how the sea flap-dragoned <END>
it: but, first, how the poor souls roared, and the <END>
sea mocked them; and how the poor gentleman roared <END>
and the bear mocked him, both roaring louder than <END>
the sea or weather. <END>
name of mercy, when was this, boy? <END>
now, now: i have not winked since i saw these <END>
sights: the men are not yet cold under water, nor <END>
the bear half dined on the gentleman: he's at it <END>
now. <END>
would i had been by, to have helped the old man! <END>
i would you had been by the ship side, to have <END>
helped her: there your charity would have lacked footing. <END>
heavy matters! heavy matters! but look thee here, <END>
boy. now bless thyself: thou mettest with things <END>
dying, i with things newborn. here's a sight for <END>
thee; look thee, a bearing-cloth for a squire's <END>
child! look thee here; take up, take up, boy; <END>
open't. so, let's see: it was told me i should be <END>
rich by the fairies. this is some changeling: <END>
open't. what's within, boy? <END>
you're a made old man: if the sins of your youth <END>
are forgiven you, you're well to live. gold! all gold! <END>
this is fairy gold, boy, and 'twill prove so: up <END>
with't, keep it close: home, home, the next way. <END>
we are lucky, boy; and to be so still requires <END>
nothing but secrecy. let my sheep go: come, good <END>
boy, the next way home. <END>
go you the next way with your findings. i'll go see <END>
if the bear be gone from the gentleman and how much <END>
he hath eaten: they are never curst but when they <END>
are hungry: if there be any of him left, i'll bury <END>
it. <END>
that's a good deed. if thou mayest discern by that <END>
which is left of him what he is, fetch me to the <END>
sight of him. <END>
marry, will i; and you shall help to put him i' the ground. <END>
'tis a lucky day, boy, and we'll do good deeds on't. <END>
i, that please some, try all, both joy and terror <END>
of good and bad, that makes and unfolds error, <END>
now take upon me, in the name of time, <END>
to use my wings. impute it not a crime <END>
to me or my swift passage, that i slide <END>
o'er sixteen years and leave the growth untried <END>
of that wide gap, since it is in my power <END>
to o'erthrow law and in one self-born hour <END>
to plant and o'erwhelm custom. let me pass <END>
the same i am, ere ancient'st order was <END>
or what is now received: i witness to <END>
the times that brought them in; so shall i do <END>
to the freshest things now reigning and make stale <END>
the glistering of this present, as my tale <END>
now seems to it. your patience this allowing, <END>
i turn my glass and give my scene such growing <END>
as you had slept between: leontes leaving, <END>
the effects of his fond jealousies so grieving <END>
that he shuts up himself, imagine me, <END>
gentle spectators, that i now may be <END>
in fair bohemia, and remember well, <END>
i mentioned a son o' the king's, which florizel <END>
i now name to you; and with speed so pace <END>
to speak of perdita, now grown in grace <END>
equal with wondering: what of her ensues <END>
i list not prophecy; but let time's news <END>
be known when 'tis brought forth. <END>
a shepherd's daughter, <END>
and what to her adheres, which follows after, <END>
is the argument of time. of this allow, <END>
if ever you have spent time worse ere now; <END>
if never, yet that time himself doth say <END>
he wishes earnestly you never may. <END>
i pray thee, good camillo, be no more importunate: <END>
'tis a sickness denying thee any thing; a death to <END>
grant this. <END>
it is fifteen years since i saw my country: though <END>
i have for the most part been aired abroad, i <END>
desire to lay my bones there. besides, the penitent <END>
king, my master, hath sent for me; to whose feeling <END>
sorrows i might be some allay, or i o'erween to <END>
think so, which is another spur to my departure. <END>
as thou lovest me, camillo, wipe not out the rest of <END>
thy services by leaving me now: the need i have of <END>
thee thine own goodness hath made; better not to <END>
have had thee than thus to want thee: thou, having <END>
made me businesses which none without thee can <END>
sufficiently manage, must either stay to execute <END>
them thyself or take away with thee the very <END>
services thou hast done; which if i have not enough <END>
considered, as too much i cannot, to be more <END>
thankful to thee shall be my study, and my profit <END>
therein the heaping friendships. of that fatal <END>
country, sicilia, prithee speak no more; whose very <END>
naming punishes me with the remembrance of that <END>
penitent, as thou callest him, and reconciled king, <END>
my brother; whose loss of his most precious queen <END>
and children are even now to be afresh lamented. <END>
say to me, when sawest thou the prince florizel, my <END>
son? kings are no less unhappy, their issue not <END>
being gracious, than they are in losing them when <END>
they have approved their virtues. <END>
sir, it is three days since i saw the prince. what <END>
his happier affairs may be, are to me unknown: but i <END>
have missingly noted, he is of late much retired <END>
from court and is less frequent to his princely <END>
exercises than formerly he hath appeared. <END>
i have considered so much, camillo, and with some <END>
care; so far that i have eyes under my service which <END>
look upon his removedness; from whom i have this <END>
intelligence, that he is seldom from the house of a <END>
most homely shepherd; a man, they say, that from <END>
very nothing, and beyond the imagination of his <END>
neighbours, is grown into an unspeakable estate. <END>
i have heard, sir, of such a man, who hath a <END>
daughter of most rare note: the report of her is <END>
extended more than can be thought to begin from such a cottage. <END>
that's likewise part of my intelligence; but, i <END>
fear, the angle that plucks our son thither. thou <END>
shalt accompany us to the place; where we will, not <END>
appearing what we are, have some question with the <END>
shepherd; from whose simplicity i think it not <END>
uneasy to get the cause of my son's resort thither. <END>
prithee, be my present partner in this business, and <END>
lay aside the thoughts of sicilia. <END>
i willingly obey your command. <END>
my best camillo! we must disguise ourselves. <END>
when daffodils begin to peer, <END>
with heigh! the doxy over the dale, <END>
why, then comes in the sweet o' the year; <END>
for the red blood reigns in the winter's pale. <END>
the white sheet bleaching on the hedge, <END>
with heigh! the sweet birds, o, how they sing! <END>
doth set my pugging tooth on edge; <END>
for a quart of ale is a dish for a king. <END>
the lark, that tirra-lyra chants, <END>
with heigh! with heigh! the thrush and the jay, <END>
are summer songs for me and my aunts, <END>
while we lie tumbling in the hay. <END>
i have served prince florizel and in my time <END>
wore three-pile; but now i am out of service: <END>
but shall i go mourn for that, my dear? <END>
the pale moon shines by night: <END>
and when i wander here and there, <END>
i then do most go right. <END>
if tinkers may have leave to live, <END>
and bear the sow-skin budget, <END>
then my account i well may, give, <END>
and in the stocks avouch it. <END>
my traffic is sheets; when the kite builds, look to <END>
lesser linen. my father named me autolycus; who <END>
being, as i am, littered under mercury, was likewise <END>
a snapper-up of unconsidered trifles. with die and <END>
drab i purchased this caparison, and my revenue is <END>
the silly cheat. gallows and knock are too powerful <END>
on the highway: beating and hanging are terrors to <END>
me: for the life to come, i sleep out the thought <END>
of it. a prize! a prize! <END>
let me see: every 'leven wether tods; every tod <END>
yields pound and odd shilling; fifteen hundred <END>
shorn. what comes the wool to? <END>
i cannot do't without counters. let me see; what am <END>
i to buy for our sheep-shearing feast? three pound <END>
of sugar, five pound of currants, rice,--what will <END>
this sister of mine do with rice? but my father <END>
hath made her mistress of the feast, and she lays it <END>
on. she hath made me four and twenty nose-gays for <END>
the shearers, three-man-song-men all, and very good <END>
ones; but they are most of them means and bases; but <END>
one puritan amongst them, and he sings psalms to <END>
horn-pipes. i must have saffron to colour the warden <END>
pies; mace; dates?--none, that's out of my note; <END>
nutmegs, seven; a race or two of ginger, but that i <END>
may beg; four pound of prunes, and as many of <END>
raisins o' the sun. <END>
o that ever i was born! <END>
i' the name of me-- <END>
o, help me, help me! pluck but off these rags; and <END>
then, death, death! <END>
alack, poor soul! thou hast need of more rags to lay <END>
on thee, rather than have these off. <END>
o sir, the loathsomeness of them offends me more <END>
than the stripes i have received, which are mighty <END>
ones and millions. <END>
alas, poor man! a million of beating may come to a <END>
great matter. <END>
i am robbed, sir, and beaten; my money and apparel <END>
ta'en from me, and these detestable things put upon <END>
me. <END>
what, by a horseman, or a footman? <END>
a footman, sweet sir, a footman. <END>
indeed, he should be a footman by the garments he <END>
has left with thee: if this be a horseman's coat, <END>
it hath seen very hot service. lend me thy hand, <END>
i'll help thee: come, lend me thy hand. <END>
o, good sir, tenderly, o! <END>
alas, poor soul! <END>
o, good sir, softly, good sir! i fear, sir, my <END>
shoulder-blade is out. <END>
how now! canst stand? <END>
dost lack any money? i have a little money for thee. <END>
no, good sweet sir; no, i beseech you, sir: i have <END>
a kinsman not past three quarters of a mile hence, <END>
unto whom i was going; i shall there have money, or <END>
any thing i want: offer me no money, i pray you; <END>
that kills my heart. <END>
what manner of fellow was he that robbed you? <END>
a fellow, sir, that i have known to go about with <END>
troll-my-dames; i knew him once a servant of the <END>
prince: i cannot tell, good sir, for which of his <END>
virtues it was, but he was certainly whipped out of the court. <END>
his vices, you would say; there's no virtue whipped <END>
out of the court: they cherish it to make it stay <END>
there; and yet it will no more but abide. <END>
vices, i would say, sir. i know this man well: he <END>
hath been since an ape-bearer; then a <END>
process-server, a bailiff; then he compassed a <END>
motion of the prodigal son, and married a tinker's <END>
wife within a mile where my land and living lies; <END>
and, having flown over many knavish professions, he <END>
settled only in rogue: some call him autolycus. <END>
out upon him! prig, for my life, prig: he haunts <END>
wakes, fairs and bear-baitings. <END>
very true, sir; he, sir, he; that's the rogue that <END>
put me into this apparel. <END>
not a more cowardly rogue in all bohemia: if you had <END>
but looked big and spit at him, he'ld have run. <END>
i must confess to you, sir, i am no fighter: i am <END>
false of heart that way; and that he knew, i warrant <END>
him. <END>
how do you now? <END>
sweet sir, much better than i was; i can stand and <END>
walk: i will even take my leave of you, and pace <END>
softly towards my kinsman's. <END>
shall i bring thee on the way? <END>
no, good-faced sir; no, sweet sir. <END>
then fare thee well: i must go buy spices for our <END>
sheep-shearing. <END>
prosper you, sweet sir! <END>
your purse is not hot enough to purchase your spice. <END>
i'll be with you at your sheep-shearing too: if i <END>
make not this cheat bring out another and the <END>
shearers prove sheep, let me be unrolled and my name <END>
put in the book of virtue! <END>
jog on, jog on, the foot-path way, <END>
and merrily hent the stile-a: <END>
a merry heart goes all the day, <END>
your sad tires in a mile-a. <END>
these your unusual weeds to each part of you <END>
do give a life: no shepherdess, but flora <END>
peering in april's front. this your sheep-shearing <END>
is as a meeting of the petty gods, <END>
and you the queen on't. <END>
sir, my gracious lord, <END>
to chide at your extremes it not becomes me: <END>
o, pardon, that i name them! your high self, <END>
the gracious mark o' the land, you have obscured <END>
with a swain's wearing, and me, poor lowly maid, <END>
most goddess-like prank'd up: but that our feasts <END>
in every mess have folly and the feeders <END>
digest it with a custom, i should blush <END>
to see you so attired, sworn, i think, <END>
to show myself a glass. <END>
i bless the time <END>
when my good falcon made her flight across <END>
thy father's ground. <END>
now jove afford you cause! <END>
to me the difference forges dread; your greatness <END>
hath not been used to fear. even now i tremble <END>
to think your father, by some accident, <END>
should pass this way as you did: o, the fates! <END>
how would he look, to see his work so noble <END>
vilely bound up? what would he say? or how <END>
should i, in these my borrow'd flaunts, behold <END>
the sternness of his presence? <END>
apprehend <END>
nothing but jollity. the gods themselves, <END>
humbling their deities to love, have taken <END>
the shapes of beasts upon them: jupiter <END>
became a bull, and bellow'd; the green neptune <END>
a ram, and bleated; and the fire-robed god, <END>
golden apollo, a poor humble swain, <END>
as i seem now. their transformations <END>
were never for a piece of beauty rarer, <END>
nor in a way so chaste, since my desires <END>
run not before mine honour, nor my lusts <END>
burn hotter than my faith. <END>
o, but, sir, <END>
your resolution cannot hold, when 'tis <END>
opposed, as it must be, by the power of the king: <END>
one of these two must be necessities, <END>
which then will speak, that you must <END>
change this purpose, <END>
or i my life. <END>
thou dearest perdita, <END>
with these forced thoughts, i prithee, darken not <END>
the mirth o' the feast. or i'll be thine, my fair, <END>
or not my father's. for i cannot be <END>
mine own, nor any thing to any, if <END>
i be not thine. to this i am most constant, <END>
though destiny say no. be merry, gentle; <END>
strangle such thoughts as these with any thing <END>
that you behold the while. your guests are coming: <END>
lift up your countenance, as it were the day <END>
of celebration of that nuptial which <END>
we two have sworn shall come. <END>
o lady fortune, <END>
stand you auspicious! <END>
see, your guests approach: <END>
address yourself to entertain them sprightly, <END>
and let's be red with mirth. <END>
fie, daughter! when my old wife lived, upon <END>
this day she was both pantler, butler, cook, <END>
both dame and servant; welcomed all, served all; <END>
would sing her song and dance her turn; now here, <END>
at upper end o' the table, now i' the middle; <END>
on his shoulder, and his; her face o' fire <END>
with labour and the thing she took to quench it, <END>
she would to each one sip. you are retired, <END>
as if you were a feasted one and not <END>
the hostess of the meeting: pray you, bid <END>
these unknown friends to's welcome; for it is <END>
a way to make us better friends, more known. <END>
come, quench your blushes and present yourself <END>
that which you are, mistress o' the feast: come on, <END>
and bid us welcome to your sheep-shearing, <END>
as your good flock shall prosper. <END>
shepherdess, <END>
a fair one are you--well you fit our ages <END>
with flowers of winter. <END>
sir, the year growing ancient, <END>
not yet on summer's death, nor on the birth <END>
of trembling winter, the fairest <END>
flowers o' the season <END>
are our carnations and streak'd gillyvors, <END>
which some call nature's bastards: of that kind <END>
our rustic garden's barren; and i care not <END>
to get slips of them. <END>
wherefore, gentle maiden, <END>
do you neglect them? <END>
for i have heard it said <END>
there is an art which in their piedness shares <END>
with great creating nature. <END>
say there be; <END>
yet nature is made better by no mean <END>
but nature makes that mean: so, over that art <END>
which you say adds to nature, is an art <END>
that nature makes. you see, sweet maid, we marry <END>
a gentler scion to the wildest stock, <END>
and make conceive a bark of baser kind <END>
by bud of nobler race: this is an art <END>
which does mend nature, change it rather, but <END>
the art itself is nature. <END>
so it is. <END>
then make your garden rich in gillyvors, <END>
and do not call them bastards. <END>
i'll not put <END>
the dibble in earth to set one slip of them; <END>
no more than were i painted i would wish <END>
this youth should say 'twere well and only therefore <END>
desire to breed by me. here's flowers for you; <END>
hot lavender, mints, savoury, marjoram; <END>
the marigold, that goes to bed wi' the sun <END>
and with him rises weeping: these are flowers <END>
of middle summer, and i think they are given <END>
to men of middle age. you're very welcome. <END>
i should leave grazing, were i of your flock, <END>
and only live by gazing. <END>
out, alas! <END>
you'd be so lean, that blasts of january <END>
would blow you through and through. <END>
now, my fair'st friend, <END>
i would i had some flowers o' the spring that might <END>
become your time of day; and yours, and yours, <END>
that wear upon your virgin branches yet <END>
your maidenheads growing: o proserpina, <END>
for the flowers now, that frighted thou let'st fall <END>
from dis's waggon! daffodils, <END>
that come before the swallow dares, and take <END>
the winds of march with beauty; violets dim, <END>
but sweeter than the lids of juno's eyes <END>
or cytherea's breath; pale primroses <END>
that die unmarried, ere they can behold <END>
bight phoebus in his strength--a malady <END>
most incident to maids; bold oxlips and <END>
the crown imperial; lilies of all kinds, <END>
the flower-de-luce being one! o, these i lack, <END>
to make you garlands of, and my sweet friend, <END>
to strew him o'er and o'er! <END>
what, like a corse? <END>
no, like a bank for love to lie and play on; <END>
not like a corse; or if, not to be buried, <END>
but quick and in mine arms. come, take your flowers: <END>
methinks i play as i have seen them do <END>
in whitsun pastorals: sure this robe of mine <END>
does change my disposition. <END>
what you do <END>
still betters what is done. when you speak, sweet. <END>
i'ld have you do it ever: when you sing, <END>
i'ld have you buy and sell so, so give alms, <END>
pray so; and, for the ordering your affairs, <END>
to sing them too: when you do dance, i wish you <END>
a wave o' the sea, that you might ever do <END>
nothing but that; move still, still so, <END>
and own no other function: each your doing, <END>
so singular in each particular, <END>
crowns what you are doing in the present deed, <END>
that all your acts are queens. <END>
o doricles, <END>
your praises are too large: but that your youth, <END>
and the true blood which peepeth fairly through't, <END>
do plainly give you out an unstain'd shepherd, <END>
with wisdom i might fear, my doricles, <END>
you woo'd me the false way. <END>
i think you have <END>
as little skill to fear as i have purpose <END>
to put you to't. but come; our dance, i pray: <END>
your hand, my perdita: so turtles pair, <END>
that never mean to part. <END>
i'll swear for 'em. <END>
this is the prettiest low-born lass that ever <END>
ran on the green-sward: nothing she does or seems <END>
but smacks of something greater than herself, <END>
too noble for this place. <END>
he tells her something <END>
that makes her blood look out: good sooth, she is <END>
the queen of curds and cream. <END>
come on, strike up! <END>
mopsa must be your mistress: marry, garlic, <END>
to mend her kissing with! <END>
now, in good time! <END>
not a word, a word; we stand upon our manners. <END>
come, strike up! <END>
pray, good shepherd, what fair swain is this <END>
which dances with your daughter? <END>
they call him doricles; and boasts himself <END>
to have a worthy feeding: but i have it <END>
upon his own report and i believe it; <END>
he looks like sooth. he says he loves my daughter: <END>
i think so too; for never gazed the moon <END>
upon the water as he'll stand and read <END>
as 'twere my daughter's eyes: and, to be plain. <END>
i think there is not half a kiss to choose <END>
who loves another best. <END>
she dances featly. <END>
so she does any thing; though i report it, <END>
that should be silent: if young doricles <END>
do light upon her, she shall bring him that <END>
which he not dreams of. <END>
o master, if you did but hear the pedlar at the <END>
door, you would never dance again after a tabour and <END>
pipe; no, the bagpipe could not move you: he sings <END>
several tunes faster than you'll tell money; he <END>
utters them as he had eaten ballads and all men's <END>
ears grew to his tunes. <END>
he could never come better; he shall come in. i <END>
love a ballad but even too well, if it be doleful <END>
matter merrily set down, or a very pleasant thing <END>
indeed and sung lamentably. <END>
he hath songs for man or woman, of all sizes; no <END>
milliner can so fit his customers with gloves: he <END>
has the prettiest love-songs for maids; so without <END>
bawdry, which is strange; with such delicate <END>
burthens of dildos and fadings, 'jump her and thump <END>
her;' and where some stretch-mouthed rascal would, <END>
as it were, mean mischief and break a foul gap into <END>
the matter, he makes the maid to answer 'whoop, do me <END>
no harm, good man;' puts him off, slights him, with <END>
'whoop, do me no harm, good man.' <END>
this is a brave fellow. <END>
believe me, thou talkest of an admirable conceited <END>
fellow. has he any unbraided wares? <END>
he hath ribbons of an the colours i' the rainbow; <END>
points more than all the lawyers in bohemia can <END>
learnedly handle, though they come to him by the <END>
gross: inkles, caddisses, cambrics, lawns: why, he <END>
sings 'em over as they were gods or goddesses; you <END>
would think a smock were a she-angel, he so chants <END>
to the sleeve-hand and the work about the square on't. <END>
prithee bring him in; and let him approach singing. <END>
forewarn him that he use no scurrilous words in 's tunes. <END>
you have of these pedlars, that have more in them <END>
than you'ld think, sister. <END>
ay, good brother, or go about to think. <END>
lawn as white as driven snow; <END>
cyprus black as e'er was crow; <END>
gloves as sweet as damask roses; <END>
masks for faces and for noses; <END>
bugle bracelet, necklace amber, <END>
perfume for a lady's chamber; <END>
golden quoifs and stomachers, <END>
for my lads to give their dears: <END>
pins and poking-sticks of steel, <END>
what maids lack from head to heel: <END>
come buy of me, come; come buy, come buy; <END>
buy lads, or else your lasses cry: come buy. <END>
if i were not in love with mopsa, thou shouldst take <END>
no money of me; but being enthralled as i am, it <END>
will also be the bondage of certain ribbons and gloves. <END>
i was promised them against the feast; but they come <END>
not too late now. <END>
he hath promised you more than that, or there be liars. <END>
he hath paid you all he promised you; may be, he has <END>
paid you more, which will shame you to give him again. <END>
is there no manners left among maids? will they <END>
wear their plackets where they should bear their <END>
faces? is there not milking-time, when you are <END>
going to bed, or kiln-hole, to whistle off these <END>
secrets, but you must be tittle-tattling before all <END>
our guests? 'tis well they are whispering: clamour <END>
your tongues, and not a word more. <END>
i have done. come, you promised me a tawdry-lace <END>
and a pair of sweet gloves. <END>
have i not told thee how i was cozened by the way <END>
and lost all my money? <END>
and indeed, sir, there are cozeners abroad; <END>
therefore it behoves men to be wary. <END>
fear not thou, man, thou shalt lose nothing here. <END>
i hope so, sir; for i have about me many parcels of charge. <END>
what hast here? ballads? <END>
pray now, buy some: i love a ballad in print o' <END>
life, for then we are sure they are true. <END>
here's one to a very doleful tune, how a usurer's <END>
wife was brought to bed of twenty money-bags at a <END>
burthen and how she longed to eat adders' heads and <END>
toads carbonadoed. <END>
is it true, think you? <END>
very true, and but a month old. <END>
bless me from marrying a usurer! <END>
here's the midwife's name to't, one mistress <END>
tale-porter, and five or six honest wives that were <END>
present. why should i carry lies abroad? <END>
pray you now, buy it. <END>
come on, lay it by: and let's first see moe <END>
ballads; we'll buy the other things anon. <END>
here's another ballad of a fish, that appeared upon <END>
the coast on wednesday the four-score of april, <END>
forty thousand fathom above water, and sung this <END>
ballad against the hard hearts of maids: it was <END>
thought she was a woman and was turned into a cold <END>
fish for she would not exchange flesh with one that <END>
loved her: the ballad is very pitiful and as true. <END>
is it true too, think you? <END>
five justices' hands at it, and witnesses more than <END>
my pack will hold. <END>
lay it by too: another. <END>
this is a merry ballad, but a very pretty one. <END>
let's have some merry ones. <END>
why, this is a passing merry one and goes to <END>
the tune of 'two maids wooing a man:' there's <END>
scarce a maid westward but she sings it; 'tis in <END>
request, i can tell you. <END>
we can both sing it: if thou'lt bear a part, thou <END>
shalt hear; 'tis in three parts. <END>
we had the tune on't a month ago. <END>
i can bear my part; you must know 'tis my <END>
occupation; have at it with you. <END>
get you hence, for i must go <END>
where it fits not you to know. <END>
whither? <END>
o, whither? <END>
whither? <END>
it becomes thy oath full well, <END>
thou to me thy secrets tell. <END>
me too, let me go thither. <END>
or thou goest to the orange or mill. <END>
if to either, thou dost ill. <END>
neither. <END>
what, neither? <END>
neither. <END>
thou hast sworn my love to be. <END>
thou hast sworn it more to me: <END>
then whither goest? say, whither? <END>
we'll have this song out anon by ourselves: my <END>
father and the gentlemen are in sad talk, and we'll <END>
not trouble them. come, bring away thy pack after <END>
me. wenches, i'll buy for you both. pedlar, let's <END>
have the first choice. follow me, girls. <END>
and you shall pay well for 'em. <END>
will you buy any tape, <END>
or lace for your cape, <END>
my dainty duck, my dear-a? <END>
any silk, any thread, <END>
any toys for your head, <END>
of the new'st and finest, finest wear-a? <END>
come to the pedlar; <END>
money's a medler. <END>
that doth utter all men's ware-a. <END>
master, there is three carters, three shepherds, <END>
three neat-herds, three swine-herds, that have made <END>
themselves all men of hair, they call themselves <END>
saltiers, and they have a dance which the wenches <END>
say is a gallimaufry of gambols, because they are <END>
not in't; but they themselves are o' the mind, if it <END>
be not too rough for some that know little but <END>
bowling, it will please plentifully. <END>
away! we'll none on 't: here has been too much <END>
homely foolery already. i know, sir, we weary you. <END>
you weary those that refresh us: pray, let's see <END>
these four threes of herdsmen. <END>
one three of them, by their own report, sir, hath <END>
danced before the king; and not the worst of the <END>
three but jumps twelve foot and a half by the squier. <END>
leave your prating: since these good men are <END>
pleased, let them come in; but quickly now. <END>
why, they stay at door, sir. <END>
o, father, you'll know more of that hereafter. <END>
is it not too far gone? 'tis time to part them. <END>
he's simple and tells much. <END>
how now, fair shepherd! <END>
your heart is full of something that does take <END>
your mind from feasting. sooth, when i was young <END>
and handed love as you do, i was wont <END>
to load my she with knacks: i would have ransack'd <END>
the pedlar's silken treasury and have pour'd it <END>
to her acceptance; you have let him go <END>
and nothing marted with him. if your lass <END>
interpretation should abuse and call this <END>
your lack of love or bounty, you were straited <END>
for a reply, at least if you make a care <END>
of happy holding her. <END>
old sir, i know <END>
she prizes not such trifles as these are: <END>
the gifts she looks from me are pack'd and lock'd <END>
up in my heart; which i have given already, <END>
but not deliver'd. o, hear me breathe my life <END>
before this ancient sir, who, it should seem, <END>
hath sometime loved! i take thy hand, this hand, <END>
as soft as dove's down and as white as it, <END>
or ethiopian's tooth, or the fann'd <END>
snow that's bolted <END>
by the northern blasts twice o'er. <END>
what follows this? <END>
how prettily the young swain seems to wash <END>
the hand was fair before! i have put you out: <END>
but to your protestation; let me hear <END>
what you profess. <END>
do, and be witness to 't. <END>
and this my neighbour too? <END>
and he, and more <END>
than he, and men, the earth, the heavens, and all: <END>
that, were i crown'd the most imperial monarch, <END>
thereof most worthy, were i the fairest youth <END>
that ever made eye swerve, had force and knowledge <END>
more than was ever man's, i would not prize them <END>
without her love; for her employ them all; <END>
commend them and condemn them to her service <END>
or to their own perdition. <END>
fairly offer'd. <END>
this shows a sound affection. <END>
but, my daughter, <END>
say you the like to him? <END>
i cannot speak <END>
so well, nothing so well; no, nor mean better: <END>
by the pattern of mine own thoughts i cut out <END>
the purity of his. <END>
take hands, a bargain! <END>
and, friends unknown, you shall bear witness to 't: <END>
i give my daughter to him, and will make <END>
her portion equal his. <END>
o, that must be <END>
i' the virtue of your daughter: one being dead, <END>
i shall have more than you can dream of yet; <END>
enough then for your wonder. but, come on, <END>
contract us 'fore these witnesses. <END>
come, your hand; <END>
and, daughter, yours. <END>
soft, swain, awhile, beseech you; <END>
have you a father? <END>
i have: but what of him? <END>
knows he of this? <END>
he neither does nor shall. <END>
methinks a father <END>
is at the nuptial of his son a guest <END>
that best becomes the table. pray you once more, <END>
is not your father grown incapable <END>
of reasonable affairs? is he not stupid <END>
with age and altering rheums? can he speak? hear? <END>
know man from man? dispute his own estate? <END>
lies he not bed-rid? and again does nothing <END>
but what he did being childish? <END>
no, good sir; <END>
he has his health and ampler strength indeed <END>
than most have of his age. <END>
by my white beard, <END>
you offer him, if this be so, a wrong <END>
something unfilial: reason my son <END>
should choose himself a wife, but as good reason <END>
the father, all whose joy is nothing else <END>
but fair posterity, should hold some counsel <END>
in such a business. <END>
i yield all this; <END>
but for some other reasons, my grave sir, <END>
which 'tis not fit you know, i not acquaint <END>
my father of this business. <END>
let him know't. <END>
he shall not. <END>
prithee, let him. <END>
no, he must not. <END>
let him, my son: he shall not need to grieve <END>
at knowing of thy choice. <END>
come, come, he must not. <END>
mark our contract. <END>
mark your divorce, young sir, <END>
whom son i dare not call; thou art too base <END>
to be acknowledged: thou a sceptre's heir, <END>
that thus affect'st a sheep-hook! thou old traitor, <END>
i am sorry that by hanging thee i can <END>
but shorten thy life one week. and thou, fresh piece <END>
of excellent witchcraft, who of force must know <END>
the royal fool thou copest with,-- <END>
o, my heart! <END>
i'll have thy beauty scratch'd with briers, and made <END>
more homely than thy state. for thee, fond boy, <END>
if i may ever know thou dost but sigh <END>
that thou no more shalt see this knack, as never <END>
i mean thou shalt, we'll bar thee from succession; <END>
not hold thee of our blood, no, not our kin, <END>
far than deucalion off: mark thou my words: <END>
follow us to the court. thou churl, for this time, <END>
though full of our displeasure, yet we free thee <END>
from the dead blow of it. and you, enchantment.-- <END>
worthy enough a herdsman: yea, him too, <END>
that makes himself, but for our honour therein, <END>
unworthy thee,--if ever henceforth thou <END>
these rural latches to his entrance open, <END>
or hoop his body more with thy embraces, <END>
i will devise a death as cruel for thee <END>
as thou art tender to't. <END>
even here undone! <END>
i was not much afeard; for once or twice <END>
i was about to speak and tell him plainly, <END>
the selfsame sun that shines upon his court <END>
hides not his visage from our cottage but <END>
looks on alike. will't please you, sir, be gone? <END>
i told you what would come of this: beseech you, <END>
of your own state take care: this dream of mine,-- <END>
being now awake, i'll queen it no inch farther, <END>
but milk my ewes and weep. <END>
why, how now, father! <END>
speak ere thou diest. <END>
i cannot speak, nor think <END>
nor dare to know that which i know. o sir! <END>
you have undone a man of fourscore three, <END>
that thought to fill his grave in quiet, yea, <END>
to die upon the bed my father died, <END>
to lie close by his honest bones: but now <END>
some hangman must put on my shroud and lay me <END>
where no priest shovels in dust. o cursed wretch, <END>
that knew'st this was the prince, <END>
and wouldst adventure <END>
to mingle faith with him! undone! undone! <END>
if i might die within this hour, i have lived <END>
to die when i desire. <END>
why look you so upon me? <END>
i am but sorry, not afeard; delay'd, <END>
but nothing alter'd: what i was, i am; <END>
more straining on for plucking back, not following <END>
my leash unwillingly. <END>
gracious my lord, <END>
you know your father's temper: at this time <END>
he will allow no speech, which i do guess <END>
you do not purpose to him; and as hardly <END>
will he endure your sight as yet, i fear: <END>
then, till the fury of his highness settle, <END>
come not before him. <END>
i not purpose it. <END>
i think, camillo? <END>
even he, my lord. <END>
how often have i told you 'twould be thus! <END>
how often said, my dignity would last <END>
but till 'twere known! <END>
it cannot fail but by <END>
the violation of my faith; and then <END>
let nature crush the sides o' the earth together <END>
and mar the seeds within! lift up thy looks: <END>
from my succession wipe me, father; i <END>
am heir to my affection. <END>
be advised. <END>
i am, and by my fancy: if my reason <END>
will thereto be obedient, i have reason; <END>
if not, my senses, better pleased with madness, <END>
do bid it welcome. <END>
this is desperate, sir. <END>
so call it: but it does fulfil my vow; <END>
i needs must think it honesty. camillo, <END>
not for bohemia, nor the pomp that may <END>
be thereat glean'd, for all the sun sees or <END>
the close earth wombs or the profound sea hides <END>
in unknown fathoms, will i break my oath <END>
to this my fair beloved: therefore, i pray you, <END>
as you have ever been my father's honour'd friend, <END>
when he shall miss me,--as, in faith, i mean not <END>
to see him any more,--cast your good counsels <END>
upon his passion; let myself and fortune <END>
tug for the time to come. this you may know <END>
and so deliver, i am put to sea <END>
with her whom here i cannot hold on shore; <END>
and most opportune to our need i have <END>
a vessel rides fast by, but not prepared <END>
for this design. what course i mean to hold <END>
shall nothing benefit your knowledge, nor <END>
concern me the reporting. <END>
o my lord! <END>
i would your spirit were easier for advice, <END>
or stronger for your need. <END>
hark, perdita <END>
i'll hear you by and by. <END>
he's irremoveable, <END>
resolved for flight. now were i happy, if <END>
his going i could frame to serve my turn, <END>
save him from danger, do him love and honour, <END>
purchase the sight again of dear sicilia <END>
and that unhappy king, my master, whom <END>
i so much thirst to see. <END>
now, good camillo; <END>
i am so fraught with curious business that <END>
i leave out ceremony. <END>
sir, i think <END>
you have heard of my poor services, i' the love <END>
that i have borne your father? <END>
very nobly <END>
have you deserved: it is my father's music <END>
to speak your deeds, not little of his care <END>
to have them recompensed as thought on. <END>
well, my lord, <END>
if you may please to think i love the king <END>
and through him what is nearest to him, which is <END>
your gracious self, embrace but my direction: <END>
if your more ponderous and settled project <END>
may suffer alteration, on mine honour, <END>
i'll point you where you shall have such receiving <END>
as shall become your highness; where you may <END>
enjoy your mistress, from the whom, i see, <END>
there's no disjunction to be made, but by-- <END>
as heavens forefend!--your ruin; marry her, <END>
and, with my best endeavours in your absence, <END>
your discontenting father strive to qualify <END>
and bring him up to liking. <END>
how, camillo, <END>
may this, almost a miracle, be done? <END>
that i may call thee something more than man <END>
and after that trust to thee. <END>
have you thought on <END>
a place whereto you'll go? <END>
not any yet: <END>
but as the unthought-on accident is guilty <END>
to what we wildly do, so we profess <END>
ourselves to be the slaves of chance and flies <END>
of every wind that blows. <END>
then list to me: <END>
this follows, if you will not change your purpose <END>
but undergo this flight, make for sicilia, <END>
and there present yourself and your fair princess, <END>
for so i see she must be, 'fore leontes: <END>
she shall be habited as it becomes <END>
the partner of your bed. methinks i see <END>
leontes opening his free arms and weeping <END>
his welcomes forth; asks thee the son forgiveness, <END>
as 'twere i' the father's person; kisses the hands <END>
of your fresh princess; o'er and o'er divides him <END>
'twixt his unkindness and his kindness; the one <END>
he chides to hell and bids the other grow <END>
faster than thought or time. <END>
worthy camillo, <END>
what colour for my visitation shall i <END>
hold up before him? <END>
sent by the king your father <END>
to greet him and to give him comforts. sir, <END>
the manner of your bearing towards him, with <END>
what you as from your father shall deliver, <END>
things known betwixt us three, i'll write you down: <END>
the which shall point you forth at every sitting <END>
what you must say; that he shall not perceive <END>
but that you have your father's bosom there <END>
and speak his very heart. <END>
i am bound to you: <END>
there is some sap in this. <END>
a cause more promising <END>
than a wild dedication of yourselves <END>
to unpath'd waters, undream'd shores, most certain <END>
to miseries enough; no hope to help you, <END>
but as you shake off one to take another; <END>
nothing so certain as your anchors, who <END>
do their best office, if they can but stay you <END>
where you'll be loath to be: besides you know <END>
prosperity's the very bond of love, <END>
whose fresh complexion and whose heart together <END>
affliction alters. <END>
one of these is true: <END>
i think affliction may subdue the cheek, <END>
but not take in the mind. <END>
yea, say you so? <END>
there shall not at your father's house these <END>
seven years <END>
be born another such. <END>
my good camillo, <END>
she is as forward of her breeding as <END>
she is i' the rear our birth. <END>
i cannot say 'tis pity <END>
she lacks instructions, for she seems a mistress <END>
to most that teach. <END>
your pardon, sir; for this <END>
i'll blush you thanks. <END>
my prettiest perdita! <END>
but o, the thorns we stand upon! camillo, <END>
preserver of my father, now of me, <END>
the medicine of our house, how shall we do? <END>
we are not furnish'd like bohemia's son, <END>
nor shall appear in sicilia. <END>
my lord, <END>
fear none of this: i think you know my fortunes <END>
do all lie there: it shall be so my care <END>
to have you royally appointed as if <END>
the scene you play were mine. for instance, sir, <END>
that you may know you shall not want, one word. <END>
ha, ha! what a fool honesty is! and trust, his <END>
sworn brother, a very simple gentleman! i have sold <END>
all my trumpery; not a counterfeit stone, not a <END>
ribbon, glass, pomander, brooch, table-book, ballad, <END>
knife, tape, glove, shoe-tie, bracelet, horn-ring, <END>
to keep my pack from fasting: they throng who <END>
should buy first, as if my trinkets had been <END>
hallowed and brought a benediction to the buyer: <END>
by which means i saw whose purse was best in <END>
picture; and what i saw, to my good use i <END>
remembered. my clown, who wants but something to <END>
be a reasonable man, grew so in love with the <END>
wenches' song, that he would not stir his pettitoes <END>
till he had both tune and words; which so drew the <END>
rest of the herd to me that all their other senses <END>
stuck in ears: you might have pinched a placket, it <END>
was senseless; 'twas nothing to geld a codpiece of a <END>
purse; i could have filed keys off that hung in <END>
chains: no hearing, no feeling, but my sir's song, <END>
and admiring the nothing of it. so that in this <END>
time of lethargy i picked and cut most of their <END>
festival purses; and had not the old man come in <END>
with a whoo-bub against his daughter and the king's <END>
son and scared my choughs from the chaff, i had not <END>
left a purse alive in the whole army. <END>
nay, but my letters, by this means being there <END>
so soon as you arrive, shall clear that doubt. <END>
and those that you'll procure from king leontes-- <END>
shall satisfy your father. <END>
happy be you! <END>
all that you speak shows fair. <END>
who have we here? <END>
we'll make an instrument of this, omit <END>
nothing may give us aid. <END>
if they have overheard me now, why, hanging. <END>
how now, good fellow! why shakest thou so? fear <END>
not, man; here's no harm intended to thee. <END>
i am a poor fellow, sir. <END>
why, be so still; here's nobody will steal that from <END>
thee: yet for the outside of thy poverty we must <END>
make an exchange; therefore discase thee instantly, <END>
--thou must think there's a necessity in't,--and <END>
change garments with this gentleman: though the <END>
pennyworth on his side be the worst, yet hold thee, <END>
there's some boot. <END>
i am a poor fellow, sir. <END>
i know ye well enough. <END>
nay, prithee, dispatch: the gentleman is half <END>
flayed already. <END>
are you in earnest, sir? <END>
i smell the trick on't. <END>
dispatch, i prithee. <END>
indeed, i have had earnest: but i cannot with <END>
conscience take it. <END>
unbuckle, unbuckle. <END>
fortunate mistress,--let my prophecy <END>
come home to ye!--you must retire yourself <END>
into some covert: take your sweetheart's hat <END>
and pluck it o'er your brows, muffle your face, <END>
dismantle you, and, as you can, disliken <END>
the truth of your own seeming; that you may-- <END>
for i do fear eyes over--to shipboard <END>
get undescried. <END>
i see the play so lies <END>
that i must bear a part. <END>
no remedy. <END>
have you done there? <END>
should i now meet my father, <END>
he would not call me son. <END>
nay, you shall have no hat. <END>
come, lady, come. farewell, my friend. <END>
adieu, sir. <END>
o perdita, what have we twain forgot! <END>
pray you, a word. <END>
fortune speed us! <END>
thus we set on, camillo, to the sea-side. <END>
the swifter speed the better. <END>
i understand the business, i hear it: to have an <END>
open ear, a quick eye, and a nimble hand, is <END>
necessary for a cut-purse; a good nose is requisite <END>
also, to smell out work for the other senses. i see <END>
this is the time that the unjust man doth thrive. <END>
what an exchange had this been without boot! what <END>
a boot is here with this exchange! sure the gods do <END>
this year connive at us, and we may do any thing <END>
extempore. the prince himself is about a piece of <END>
iniquity, stealing away from his father with his <END>
clog at his heels: if i thought it were a piece of <END>
honesty to acquaint the king withal, i would not <END>
do't: i hold it the more knavery to conceal it; <END>
and therein am i constant to my profession. <END>
aside, aside; here is more matter for a hot brain: <END>
every lane's end, every shop, church, session, <END>
hanging, yields a careful man work. <END>
see, see; what a man you are now! <END>
there is no other way but to tell the king <END>
she's a changeling and none of your flesh and blood. <END>
nay, but hear me. <END>
nay, but hear me. <END>
go to, then. <END>
she being none of your flesh and blood, your flesh <END>
and blood has not offended the king; and so your <END>
flesh and blood is not to be punished by him. show <END>
those things you found about her, those secret <END>
things, all but what she has with her: this being <END>
done, let the law go whistle: i warrant you. <END>
i will tell the king all, every word, yea, and his <END>
son's pranks too; who, i may say, is no honest man, <END>
neither to his father nor to me, to go about to make <END>
me the king's brother-in-law. <END>
indeed, brother-in-law was the farthest off you <END>
could have been to him and then your blood had been <END>
the dearer by i know how much an ounce. <END>
well, let us to the king: there is that in this <END>
fardel will make him scratch his beard. <END>
pray heartily he be at palace. <END>
to the palace, an it like your worship. <END>
your affairs there, what, with whom, the condition <END>
of that fardel, the place of your dwelling, your <END>
names, your ages, of what having, breeding, and any <END>
thing that is fitting to be known, discover. <END>
we are but plain fellows, sir. <END>
a lie; you are rough and hairy. let me have no <END>
lying: it becomes none but tradesmen, and they <END>
often give us soldiers the lie: but we pay them for <END>
it with stamped coin, not stabbing steel; therefore <END>
they do not give us the lie. <END>
your worship had like to have given us one, if you <END>
had not taken yourself with the manner. <END>
are you a courtier, an't like you, sir? <END>
whether it like me or no, i am a courtier. seest <END>
thou not the air of the court in these enfoldings? <END>
hath not my gait in it the measure of the court? <END>
receives not thy nose court-odor from me? reflect i <END>
not on thy baseness court-contempt? thinkest thou, <END>
for that i insinuate, or toaze from thee thy <END>
business, i am therefore no courtier? i am courtier <END>
cap-a-pe; and one that will either push on or pluck <END>
back thy business there: whereupon i command thee to <END>
open thy affair. <END>
my business, sir, is to the king. <END>
what advocate hast thou to him? <END>
i know not, an't like you. <END>
advocate's the court-word for a pheasant: say you <END>
have none. <END>
none, sir; i have no pheasant, cock nor hen. <END>
how blessed are we that are not simple men! <END>
yet nature might have made me as these are, <END>
therefore i will not disdain. <END>
this cannot be but a great courtier. <END>
his garments are rich, but he wears <END>
them not handsomely. <END>
he seems to be the more noble in being fantastical: <END>
a great man, i'll warrant; i know by the picking <END>
on's teeth. <END>
the fardel there? what's i' the fardel? <END>
wherefore that box? <END>
sir, there lies such secrets in this fardel and box, <END>
which none must know but the king; and which he <END>
shall know within this hour, if i may come to the <END>
speech of him. <END>
age, thou hast lost thy labour. <END>
why, sir? <END>
the king is not at the palace; he is gone aboard a <END>
new ship to purge melancholy and air himself: for, <END>
if thou beest capable of things serious, thou must <END>
know the king is full of grief. <END>
so 'tis said, sir; about his son, that should have <END>
married a shepherd's daughter. <END>
if that shepherd be not in hand-fast, let him fly: <END>
the curses he shall have, the tortures he shall <END>
feel, will break the back of man, the heart of monster. <END>
think you so, sir? <END>
not he alone shall suffer what wit can make heavy <END>
and vengeance bitter; but those that are germane to <END>
him, though removed fifty times, shall all come <END>
under the hangman: which though it be great pity, <END>
yet it is necessary. an old sheep-whistling rogue a <END>
ram-tender, to offer to have his daughter come into <END>
grace! some say he shall be stoned; but that death <END>
is too soft for him, say i draw our throne into a <END>
sheep-cote! all deaths are too few, the sharpest too easy. <END>
has the old man e'er a son, sir, do you hear. an't <END>
like you, sir? <END>
he has a son, who shall be flayed alive; then <END>
'nointed over with honey, set on the head of a <END>
wasp's nest; then stand till he be three quarters <END>
and a dram dead; then recovered again with <END>
aqua-vitae or some other hot infusion; then, raw as <END>
he is, and in the hottest day prognostication <END>
proclaims, shall be be set against a brick-wall, the <END>
sun looking with a southward eye upon him, where he <END>
is to behold him with flies blown to death. but what <END>
talk we of these traitorly rascals, whose miseries <END>
are to be smiled at, their offences being so <END>
capital? tell me, for you seem to be honest plain <END>
men, what you have to the king: being something <END>
gently considered, i'll bring you where he is <END>
aboard, tender your persons to his presence, <END>
whisper him in your behalfs; and if it be in man <END>
besides the king to effect your suits, here is man <END>
shall do it. <END>
he seems to be of great authority: close with him, <END>
give him gold; and though authority be a stubborn <END>
bear, yet he is oft led by the nose with gold: show <END>
the inside of your purse to the outside of his hand, <END>
and no more ado. remember 'stoned,' and 'flayed alive.' <END>
an't please you, sir, to undertake the business for <END>
us, here is that gold i have: i'll make it as much <END>
more and leave this young man in pawn till i bring it you. <END>
after i have done what i promised? <END>
ay, sir. <END>
well, give me the moiety. are you a party in this business? <END>
in some sort, sir: but though my case be a pitiful <END>
one, i hope i shall not be flayed out of it. <END>
o, that's the case of the shepherd's son: hang him, <END>
he'll be made an example. <END>
comfort, good comfort! we must to the king and show <END>
our strange sights: he must know 'tis none of your <END>
daughter nor my sister; we are gone else. sir, i <END>
will give you as much as this old man does when the <END>
business is performed, and remain, as he says, your <END>
pawn till it be brought you. <END>
i will trust you. walk before toward the sea-side; <END>
go on the right hand: i will but look upon the <END>
hedge and follow you. <END>
we are blest in this man, as i may say, even blest. <END>
let's before as he bids us: he was provided to do us good. <END>
if i had a mind to be honest, i see fortune would <END>
not suffer me: she drops booties in my mouth. i am <END>
courted now with a double occasion, gold and a means <END>
to do the prince my master good; which who knows how <END>
that may turn back to my advancement? i will bring <END>
these two moles, these blind ones, aboard him: if he <END>
think it fit to shore them again and that the <END>
complaint they have to the king concerns him <END>
nothing, let him call me rogue for being so far <END>
officious; for i am proof against that title and <END>
what shame else belongs to't. to him will i present <END>
them: there may be matter in it. <END>
sir, you have done enough, and have perform'd <END>
a saint-like sorrow: no fault could you make, <END>
which you have not redeem'd; indeed, paid down <END>
more penitence than done trespass: at the last, <END>
do as the heavens have done, forget your evil; <END>
with them forgive yourself. <END>
whilst i remember <END>
her and her virtues, i cannot forget <END>
my blemishes in them, and so still think of <END>
the wrong i did myself; which was so much, <END>
that heirless it hath made my kingdom and <END>
destroy'd the sweet'st companion that e'er man <END>
bred his hopes out of. <END>
true, too true, my lord: <END>
if, one by one, you wedded all the world, <END>
or from the all that are took something good, <END>
to make a perfect woman, she you kill'd <END>
would be unparallel'd. <END>
i think so. kill'd! <END>
she i kill'd! i did so: but thou strikest me <END>
sorely, to say i did; it is as bitter <END>
upon thy tongue as in my thought: now, good now, <END>
say so but seldom. <END>
not at all, good lady: <END>
you might have spoken a thousand things that would <END>
have done the time more benefit and graced <END>
your kindness better. <END>
you are one of those <END>
would have him wed again. <END>
if you would not so, <END>
you pity not the state, nor the remembrance <END>
of his most sovereign name; consider little <END>
what dangers, by his highness' fail of issue, <END>
may drop upon his kingdom and devour <END>
incertain lookers on. what were more holy <END>
than to rejoice the former queen is well? <END>
what holier than, for royalty's repair, <END>
for present comfort and for future good, <END>
to bless the bed of majesty again <END>
with a sweet fellow to't? <END>
there is none worthy, <END>
respecting her that's gone. besides, the gods <END>
will have fulfill'd their secret purposes; <END>
for has not the divine apollo said, <END>
is't not the tenor of his oracle, <END>
that king leontes shall not have an heir <END>
till his lost child be found? which that it shall, <END>
is all as monstrous to our human reason <END>
as my antigonus to break his grave <END>
and come again to me; who, on my life, <END>
did perish with the infant. 'tis your counsel <END>
my lord should to the heavens be contrary, <END>
oppose against their wills. <END>
care not for issue; <END>
the crown will find an heir: great alexander <END>
left his to the worthiest; so his successor <END>
was like to be the best. <END>
good paulina, <END>
who hast the memory of hermione, <END>
i know, in honour, o, that ever i <END>
had squared me to thy counsel! then, even now, <END>
i might have look'd upon my queen's full eyes, <END>
have taken treasure from her lips-- <END>
and left them <END>
more rich for what they yielded. <END>
thou speak'st truth. <END>
no more such wives; therefore, no wife: one worse, <END>
and better used, would make her sainted spirit <END>
again possess her corpse, and on this stage, <END>
where we're offenders now, appear soul-vex'd, <END>
and begin, 'why to me?' <END>
had she such power, <END>
she had just cause. <END>
she had; and would incense me <END>
to murder her i married. <END>
i should so. <END>
were i the ghost that walk'd, i'ld bid you mark <END>
her eye, and tell me for what dull part in't <END>
you chose her; then i'ld shriek, that even your ears <END>
should rift to hear me; and the words that follow'd <END>
should be 'remember mine.' <END>
stars, stars, <END>
and all eyes else dead coals! fear thou no wife; <END>
i'll have no wife, paulina. <END>
will you swear <END>
never to marry but by my free leave? <END>
never, paulina; so be blest my spirit! <END>
then, good my lords, bear witness to his oath. <END>
you tempt him over-much. <END>
unless another, <END>
as like hermione as is her picture, <END>
affront his eye. <END>
good madam,-- <END>
i have done. <END>
yet, if my lord will marry,--if you will, sir, <END>
no remedy, but you will,--give me the office <END>
to choose you a queen: she shall not be so young <END>
as was your former; but she shall be such <END>
as, walk'd your first queen's ghost, <END>
it should take joy <END>
to see her in your arms. <END>
my true paulina, <END>
we shall not marry till thou bid'st us. <END>
that <END>
shall be when your first queen's again in breath; <END>
never till then. <END>
one that gives out himself prince florizel, <END>
son of polixenes, with his princess, she <END>
the fairest i have yet beheld, desires access <END>
to your high presence. <END>
what with him? he comes not <END>
like to his father's greatness: his approach, <END>
so out of circumstance and sudden, tells us <END>
'tis not a visitation framed, but forced <END>
by need and accident. what train? <END>
but few, <END>
and those but mean. <END>
his princess, say you, with him? <END>
ay, the most peerless piece of earth, i think, <END>
that e'er the sun shone bright on. <END>
o hermione, <END>
as every present time doth boast itself <END>
above a better gone, so must thy grave <END>
give way to what's seen now! sir, you yourself <END>
have said and writ so, but your writing now <END>
is colder than that theme, 'she had not been, <END>
nor was not to be equall'd;'--thus your verse <END>
flow'd with her beauty once: 'tis shrewdly ebb'd, <END>
to say you have seen a better. <END>
pardon, madam: <END>
the one i have almost forgot,--your pardon,-- <END>
the other, when she has obtain'd your eye, <END>
will have your tongue too. this is a creature, <END>
would she begin a sect, might quench the zeal <END>
of all professors else, make proselytes <END>
of who she but bid follow. <END>
how! not women? <END>
women will love her, that she is a woman <END>
more worth than any man; men, that she is <END>
the rarest of all women. <END>
go, cleomenes; <END>
yourself, assisted with your honour'd friends, <END>
bring them to our embracement. still, 'tis strange <END>
he thus should steal upon us. <END>
had our prince, <END>
jewel of children, seen this hour, he had pair'd <END>
well with this lord: there was not full a month <END>
between their births. <END>
prithee, no more; cease; thou know'st <END>
he dies to me again when talk'd of: sure, <END>
when i shall see this gentleman, thy speeches <END>
will bring me to consider that which may <END>
unfurnish me of reason. they are come. <END>
your mother was most true to wedlock, prince; <END>
for she did print your royal father off, <END>
conceiving you: were i but twenty-one, <END>
your father's image is so hit in you, <END>
his very air, that i should call you brother, <END>
as i did him, and speak of something wildly <END>
by us perform'd before. most dearly welcome! <END>
and your fair princess,--goddess!--o, alas! <END>
i lost a couple, that 'twixt heaven and earth <END>
might thus have stood begetting wonder as <END>
you, gracious couple, do: and then i lost-- <END>
all mine own folly--the society, <END>
amity too, of your brave father, whom, <END>
though bearing misery, i desire my life <END>
once more to look on him. <END>
by his command <END>
have i here touch'd sicilia and from him <END>
give you all greetings that a king, at friend, <END>
can send his brother: and, but infirmity <END>
which waits upon worn times hath something seized <END>
his wish'd ability, he had himself <END>
the lands and waters 'twixt your throne and his <END>
measured to look upon you; whom he loves-- <END>
he bade me say so--more than all the sceptres <END>
and those that bear them living. <END>
o my brother, <END>
good gentleman! the wrongs i have done thee stir <END>
afresh within me, and these thy offices, <END>
so rarely kind, are as interpreters <END>
of my behind-hand slackness. welcome hither, <END>
as is the spring to the earth. and hath he too <END>
exposed this paragon to the fearful usage, <END>
at least ungentle, of the dreadful neptune, <END>
to greet a man not worth her pains, much less <END>
the adventure of her person? <END>
good my lord, <END>
she came from libya. <END>
where the warlike smalus, <END>
that noble honour'd lord, is fear'd and loved? <END>
most royal sir, from thence; from him, whose daughter <END>
his tears proclaim'd his, parting with her: thence, <END>
a prosperous south-wind friendly, we have cross'd, <END>
to execute the charge my father gave me <END>
for visiting your highness: my best train <END>
i have from your sicilian shores dismiss'd; <END>
who for bohemia bend, to signify <END>
not only my success in libya, sir, <END>
but my arrival and my wife's in safety <END>
here where we are. <END>
the blessed gods <END>
purge all infection from our air whilst you <END>
do climate here! you have a holy father, <END>
a graceful gentleman; against whose person, <END>
so sacred as it is, i have done sin: <END>
for which the heavens, taking angry note, <END>
have left me issueless; and your father's blest, <END>
as he from heaven merits it, with you <END>
worthy his goodness. what might i have been, <END>
might i a son and daughter now have look'd on, <END>
such goodly things as you! <END>
most noble sir, <END>
that which i shall report will bear no credit, <END>
were not the proof so nigh. please you, great sir, <END>
bohemia greets you from himself by me; <END>
desires you to attach his son, who has-- <END>
his dignity and duty both cast off-- <END>
fled from his father, from his hopes, and with <END>
a shepherd's daughter. <END>
where's bohemia? speak. <END>
here in your city; i now came from him: <END>
i speak amazedly; and it becomes <END>
my marvel and my message. to your court <END>
whiles he was hastening, in the chase, it seems, <END>
of this fair couple, meets he on the way <END>
the father of this seeming lady and <END>
her brother, having both their country quitted <END>
with this young prince. <END>
camillo has betray'd me; <END>
whose honour and whose honesty till now <END>
endured all weathers. <END>
lay't so to his charge: <END>
he's with the king your father. <END>
who? camillo? <END>
camillo, sir; i spake with him; who now <END>
has these poor men in question. never saw i <END>
wretches so quake: they kneel, they kiss the earth; <END>
forswear themselves as often as they speak: <END>
bohemia stops his ears, and threatens them <END>
with divers deaths in death. <END>
o my poor father! <END>
the heaven sets spies upon us, will not have <END>
our contract celebrated. <END>
you are married? <END>
we are not, sir, nor are we like to be; <END>
the stars, i see, will kiss the valleys first: <END>
the odds for high and low's alike. <END>
my lord, <END>
is this the daughter of a king? <END>
she is, <END>
when once she is my wife. <END>
that 'once' i see by your good father's speed <END>
will come on very slowly. i am sorry, <END>
most sorry, you have broken from his liking <END>
where you were tied in duty, and as sorry <END>
your choice is not so rich in worth as beauty, <END>
that you might well enjoy her. <END>
dear, look up: <END>
though fortune, visible an enemy, <END>
should chase us with my father, power no jot <END>
hath she to change our loves. beseech you, sir, <END>
remember since you owed no more to time <END>
than i do now: with thought of such affections, <END>
step forth mine advocate; at your request <END>
my father will grant precious things as trifles. <END>
would he do so, i'ld beg your precious mistress, <END>
which he counts but a trifle. <END>
sir, my liege, <END>
your eye hath too much youth in't: not a month <END>
'fore your queen died, she was more worth such gazes <END>
than what you look on now. <END>
i thought of her, <END>
even in these looks i made. <END>
but your petition <END>
is yet unanswer'd. i will to your father: <END>
your honour not o'erthrown by your desires, <END>
i am friend to them and you: upon which errand <END>
i now go toward him; therefore follow me <END>
and mark what way i make: come, good my lord. <END>
beseech you, sir, were you present at this relation? <END>
i was by at the opening of the fardel, heard the old <END>
shepherd deliver the manner how he found it: <END>
whereupon, after a little amazedness, we were all <END>
commanded out of the chamber; only this methought i <END>
heard the shepherd say, he found the child. <END>
i would most gladly know the issue of it. <END>
i make a broken delivery of the business; but the <END>
changes i perceived in the king and camillo were <END>
very notes of admiration: they seemed almost, with <END>
staring on one another, to tear the cases of their <END>
eyes; there was speech in their dumbness, language <END>
in their very gesture; they looked as they had heard <END>
of a world ransomed, or one destroyed: a notable <END>
passion of wonder appeared in them; but the wisest <END>
beholder, that knew no more but seeing, could not <END>
say if the importance were joy or sorrow; but in the <END>
extremity of the one, it must needs be. <END>
here comes a gentleman that haply knows more. <END>
the news, rogero? <END>
nothing but bonfires: the oracle is fulfilled; the <END>
king's daughter is found: such a deal of wonder is <END>
broken out within this hour that ballad-makers <END>
cannot be able to express it. <END>
here comes the lady paulina's steward: he can <END>
deliver you more. how goes it now, sir? this news <END>
which is called true is so like an old tale, that <END>
the verity of it is in strong suspicion: has the king <END>
found his heir? <END>
most true, if ever truth were pregnant by <END>
circumstance: that which you hear you'll swear you <END>
see, there is such unity in the proofs. the mantle <END>
of queen hermione's, her jewel about the neck of it, <END>
the letters of antigonus found with it which they <END>
know to be his character, the majesty of the <END>
creature in resemblance of the mother, the affection <END>
of nobleness which nature shows above her breeding, <END>
and many other evidences proclaim her with all <END>
certainty to be the king's daughter. did you see <END>
the meeting of the two kings? <END>
no. <END>
then have you lost a sight, which was to be seen, <END>
cannot be spoken of. there might you have beheld one <END>
joy crown another, so and in such manner that it <END>
seemed sorrow wept to take leave of them, for their <END>
joy waded in tears. there was casting up of eyes, <END>
holding up of hands, with countenances of such <END>
distraction that they were to be known by garment, <END>
not by favour. our king, being ready to leap out of <END>
himself for joy of his found daughter, as if that <END>
joy were now become a loss, cries 'o, thy mother, <END>
thy mother!' then asks bohemia forgiveness; then <END>
embraces his son-in-law; then again worries he his <END>
daughter with clipping her; now he thanks the old <END>
shepherd, which stands by like a weather-bitten <END>
conduit of many kings' reigns. i never heard of such <END>
another encounter, which lames report to follow it <END>
and undoes description to do it. <END>
what, pray you, became of antigonus, that carried <END>
hence the child? <END>
like an old tale still, which will have matter to <END>
rehearse, though credit be asleep and not an ear <END>
open. he was torn to pieces with a bear: this <END>
avouches the shepherd's son; who has not only his <END>
innocence, which seems much, to justify him, but a <END>
handkerchief and rings of his that paulina knows. <END>
what became of his bark and his followers? <END>
wrecked the same instant of their master's death and <END>
in the view of the shepherd: so that all the <END>
instruments which aided to expose the child were <END>
even then lost when it was found. but o, the noble <END>
combat that 'twixt joy and sorrow was fought in <END>
paulina! she had one eye declined for the loss of <END>
her husband, another elevated that the oracle was <END>
fulfilled: she lifted the princess from the earth, <END>
and so locks her in embracing, as if she would pin <END>
her to her heart that she might no more be in danger <END>
of losing. <END>
the dignity of this act was worth the audience of <END>
kings and princes; for by such was it acted. <END>
one of the prettiest touches of all and that which <END>
angled for mine eyes, caught the water though not <END>
the fish, was when, at the relation of the queen's <END>
death, with the manner how she came to't bravely <END>
confessed and lamented by the king, how <END>
attentiveness wounded his daughter; till, from one <END>
sign of dolour to another, she did, with an 'alas,' <END>
i would fain say, bleed tears, for i am sure my <END>
heart wept blood. who was most marble there changed <END>
colour; some swooned, all sorrowed: if all the world <END>
could have seen 't, the woe had been universal. <END>
are they returned to the court? <END>
which is in the keeping of paulina,--a piece many <END>
years in doing and now newly performed by that rare <END>
italian master, julio romano, who, had he himself <END>
eternity and could put breath into his work, would <END>
beguile nature of her custom, so perfectly he is her <END>
ape: he so near to hermione hath done hermione that <END>
they say one would speak to her and stand in hope of <END>
answer: thither with all greediness of affection <END>
are they gone, and there they intend to sup. <END>
i thought she had some great matter there in hand; <END>
for she hath privately twice or thrice a day, ever <END>
since the death of hermione, visited that removed <END>
house. shall we thither and with our company piece <END>
the rejoicing? <END>
who would be thence that has the benefit of access? <END>
every wink of an eye some new grace will be born: <END>
our absence makes us unthrifty to our knowledge. <END>
let's along. <END>
now, had i not the dash of my former life in me, <END>
would preferment drop on my head. i brought the old <END>
man and his son aboard the prince: told him i heard <END>
them talk of a fardel and i know not what: but he <END>
at that time, overfond of the shepherd's daughter, <END>
so he then took her to be, who began to be much <END>
sea-sick, and himself little better, extremity of <END>
weather continuing, this mystery remained <END>
undiscovered. but 'tis all one to me; for had i <END>
been the finder out of this secret, it would not <END>
have relished among my other discredits. <END>
here come those i have done good to against my will, <END>
and already appearing in the blossoms of their fortune. <END>
come, boy; i am past moe children, but thy sons and <END>
daughters will be all gentlemen born. <END>
you are well met, sir. you denied to fight with me <END>
this other day, because i was no gentleman born. <END>
see you these clothes? say you see them not and <END>
think me still no gentleman born: you were best say <END>
these robes are not gentlemen born: give me the <END>
lie, do, and try whether i am not now a gentleman born. <END>
i know you are now, sir, a gentleman born. <END>
ay, and have been so any time these four hours. <END>
and so have i, boy. <END>
so you have: but i was a gentleman born before my <END>
father; for the king's son took me by the hand, and <END>
called me brother; and then the two kings called my <END>
father brother; and then the prince my brother and <END>
the princess my sister called my father father; and <END>
so we wept, and there was the first gentleman-like <END>
tears that ever we shed. <END>
we may live, son, to shed many more. <END>
ay; or else 'twere hard luck, being in so <END>
preposterous estate as we are. <END>
i humbly beseech you, sir, to pardon me all the <END>
faults i have committed to your worship and to give <END>
me your good report to the prince my master. <END>
prithee, son, do; for we must be gentle, now we are <END>
gentlemen. <END>
thou wilt amend thy life? <END>
ay, an it like your good worship. <END>
give me thy hand: i will swear to the prince thou <END>
art as honest a true fellow as any is in bohemia. <END>
you may say it, but not swear it. <END>
not swear it, now i am a gentleman? let boors and <END>
franklins say it, i'll swear it. <END>
how if it be false, son? <END>
if it be ne'er so false, a true gentleman may swear <END>
it in the behalf of his friend: and i'll swear to <END>
the prince thou art a tall fellow of thy hands and <END>
that thou wilt not be drunk; but i know thou art no <END>
tall fellow of thy hands and that thou wilt be <END>
drunk: but i'll swear it, and i would thou wouldst <END>
be a tall fellow of thy hands. <END>
i will prove so, sir, to my power. <END>
ay, by any means prove a tall fellow: if i do not <END>
wonder how thou darest venture to be drunk, not <END>
being a tall fellow, trust me not. hark! the kings <END>
and the princes, our kindred, are going to see the <END>
queen's picture. come, follow us: we'll be thy <END>
good masters. <END>
o grave and good paulina, the great comfort <END>
that i have had of thee! <END>
what, sovereign sir, <END>
i did not well i meant well. all my services <END>
you have paid home: but that you have vouchsafed, <END>
with your crown'd brother and these your contracted <END>
heirs of your kingdoms, my poor house to visit, <END>
it is a surplus of your grace, which never <END>
my life may last to answer. <END>
o paulina, <END>
we honour you with trouble: but we came <END>
to see the statue of our queen: your gallery <END>
have we pass'd through, not without much content <END>
in many singularities; but we saw not <END>
that which my daughter came to look upon, <END>
the statue of her mother. <END>
as she lived peerless, <END>
so her dead likeness, i do well believe, <END>
excels whatever yet you look'd upon <END>
or hand of man hath done; therefore i keep it <END>
lonely, apart. but here it is: prepare <END>
to see the life as lively mock'd as ever <END>
still sleep mock'd death: behold, and say 'tis well. <END>
i like your silence, it the more shows off <END>
your wonder: but yet speak; first, you, my liege, <END>
comes it not something near? <END>
her natural posture! <END>
chide me, dear stone, that i may say indeed <END>
thou art hermione; or rather, thou art she <END>
in thy not chiding, for she was as tender <END>
as infancy and grace. but yet, paulina, <END>
hermione was not so much wrinkled, nothing <END>
so aged as this seems. <END>
o, not by much. <END>
so much the more our carver's excellence; <END>
which lets go by some sixteen years and makes her <END>
as she lived now. <END>
as now she might have done, <END>
so much to my good comfort, as it is <END>
now piercing to my soul. o, thus she stood, <END>
even with such life of majesty, warm life, <END>
as now it coldly stands, when first i woo'd her! <END>
i am ashamed: does not the stone rebuke me <END>
for being more stone than it? o royal piece, <END>
there's magic in thy majesty, which has <END>
my evils conjured to remembrance and <END>
from thy admiring daughter took the spirits, <END>
standing like stone with thee. <END>
and give me leave, <END>
and do not say 'tis superstition, that <END>
i kneel and then implore her blessing. lady, <END>
dear queen, that ended when i but began, <END>
give me that hand of yours to kiss. <END>
o, patience! <END>
the statue is but newly fix'd, the colour's not dry. <END>
my lord, your sorrow was too sore laid on, <END>
which sixteen winters cannot blow away, <END>
so many summers dry; scarce any joy <END>
did ever so long live; no sorrow <END>
but kill'd itself much sooner. <END>
dear my brother, <END>
let him that was the cause of this have power <END>
to take off so much grief from you as he <END>
will piece up in himself. <END>
indeed, my lord, <END>
if i had thought the sight of my poor image <END>
would thus have wrought you,--for the stone is mine-- <END>
i'ld not have show'd it. <END>
do not draw the curtain. <END>
no longer shall you gaze on't, lest your fancy <END>
may think anon it moves. <END>
let be, let be. <END>
would i were dead, but that, methinks, already-- <END>
what was he that did make it? see, my lord, <END>
would you not deem it breathed? and that those veins <END>
did verily bear blood? <END>
masterly done: <END>
the very life seems warm upon her lip. <END>
the fixture of her eye has motion in't, <END>
as we are mock'd with art. <END>
i'll draw the curtain: <END>
my lord's almost so far transported that <END>
he'll think anon it lives. <END>
o sweet paulina, <END>
make me to think so twenty years together! <END>
no settled senses of the world can match <END>
the pleasure of that madness. let 't alone. <END>
i am sorry, sir, i have thus far stirr'd you: but <END>
i could afflict you farther. <END>
do, paulina; <END>
for this affliction has a taste as sweet <END>
as any cordial comfort. still, methinks, <END>
there is an air comes from her: what fine chisel <END>
could ever yet cut breath? let no man mock me, <END>
for i will kiss her. <END>
good my lord, forbear: <END>
the ruddiness upon her lip is wet; <END>
you'll mar it if you kiss it, stain your own <END>
with oily painting. shall i draw the curtain? <END>
no, not these twenty years. <END>
so long could i <END>
stand by, a looker on. <END>
either forbear, <END>
quit presently the chapel, or resolve you <END>
for more amazement. if you can behold it, <END>
i'll make the statue move indeed, descend <END>
and take you by the hand; but then you'll think-- <END>
which i protest against--i am assisted <END>
by wicked powers. <END>
what you can make her do, <END>
i am content to look on: what to speak, <END>
i am content to hear; for 'tis as easy <END>
to make her speak as move. <END>
it is required <END>
you do awake your faith. then all stand still; <END>
i am about, let them depart. <END>
no foot shall stir. <END>
music, awake her; strike! <END>
'tis time; descend; be stone no more; approach; <END>
strike all that look upon with marvel. come, <END>
i'll fill your grave up: stir, nay, come away, <END>
bequeath to death your numbness, for from him <END>
dear life redeems you. you perceive she stirs: <END>
start not; her actions shall be holy as <END>
you hear my spell is lawful: do not shun her <END>
until you see her die again; for then <END>
you kill her double. nay, present your hand: <END>
when she was young you woo'd her; now in age <END>
is she become the suitor? <END>
o, she's warm! <END>
if this be magic, let it be an art <END>
lawful as eating. <END>
she embraces him. <END>
she hangs about his neck: <END>
if she pertain to life let her speak too. <END>
ay, and make't manifest where she has lived, <END>
or how stolen from the dead. <END>
that she is living, <END>
were it but told you, should be hooted at <END>
like an old tale: but it appears she lives, <END>
though yet she speak not. mark a little while. <END>
please you to interpose, fair madam: kneel <END>
and pray your mother's blessing. turn, good lady; <END>
our perdita is found. <END>
you gods, look down <END>
and from your sacred vials pour your graces <END>
upon my daughter's head! tell me, mine own. <END>
where hast thou been preserved? where lived? how found <END>
thy father's court? for thou shalt hear that i, <END>
knowing by paulina that the oracle <END>
gave hope thou wast in being, have preserved <END>
myself to see the issue. <END>
there's time enough for that; <END>
lest they desire upon this push to trouble <END>
your joys with like relation. go together, <END>
you precious winners all; your exultation <END>
partake to every one. i, an old turtle, <END>
will wing me to some wither'd bough and there <END>
my mate, that's never to be found again, <END>
lament till i am lost. <END>
o, peace, paulina! <END>
thou shouldst a husband take by my consent, <END>
as i by thine a wife: this is a match, <END>
and made between's by vows. thou hast found mine; <END>
but how, is to be question'd; for i saw her, <END>
as i thought, dead, and have in vain said many <END>
a prayer upon her grave. i'll not seek far-- <END>
for him, i partly know his mind--to find thee <END>
an honourable husband. come, camillo, <END>
and take her by the hand, whose worth and honesty <END>
is richly noted and here justified <END>
by us, a pair of kings. let's from this place. <END>
what! look upon my brother: both your pardons, <END>
that e'er i put between your holy looks <END>
my ill suspicion. this is your son-in-law, <END>
and son unto the king, who, heavens directing, <END>
is troth-plight to your daughter. good paulina, <END>
lead us from hence, where we may leisurely <END>
each one demand an answer to his part <END>
perform'd in this wide gap of time since first <END>
we were dissever'd: hastily lead away. <END>
escalus. <END>
my lord. <END>
of government the properties to unfold, <END>
would seem in me to affect speech and discourse; <END>
since i am put to know that your own science <END>
exceeds, in that, the lists of all advice <END>
my strength can give you: then no more remains, <END>
but that to your sufficiency, as your worth is able, <END>
and let them work. the nature of our people, <END>
our city's institutions, and the terms <END>
for common justice, you're as pregnant in <END>
as art and practise hath enriched any <END>
that we remember. there is our commission, <END>
from which we would not have you warp. call hither, <END>
i say, bid come before us angelo. <END>
what figure of us think you he will bear? <END>
for you must know, we have with special soul <END>
elected him our absence to supply, <END>
lent him our terror, dress'd him with our love, <END>
and given his deputation all the organs <END>
of our own power: what think you of it? <END>
if any in vienna be of worth <END>
to undergo such ample grace and honour, <END>
it is lord angelo. <END>
look where he comes. <END>
always obedient to your grace's will, <END>
i come to know your pleasure. <END>
angelo, <END>
there is a kind of character in thy life, <END>
that to the observer doth thy history <END>
fully unfold. thyself and thy belongings <END>
are not thine own so proper as to waste <END>
thyself upon thy virtues, they on thee. <END>
heaven doth with us as we with torches do, <END>
not light them for themselves; for if our virtues <END>
did not go forth of us, 'twere all alike <END>
as if we had them not. spirits are not finely touch'd <END>
but to fine issues, nor nature never lends <END>
the smallest scruple of her excellence <END>
but, like a thrifty goddess, she determines <END>
herself the glory of a creditor, <END>
both thanks and use. but i do bend my speech <END>
to one that can my part in him advertise; <END>
hold therefore, angelo:-- <END>
in our remove be thou at full ourself; <END>
mortality and mercy in vienna <END>
live in thy tongue and heart: old escalus, <END>
though first in question, is thy secondary. <END>
take thy commission. <END>
now, good my lord, <END>
let there be some more test made of my metal, <END>
before so noble and so great a figure <END>
be stamp'd upon it. <END>
no more evasion: <END>
we have with a leaven'd and prepared choice <END>
proceeded to you; therefore take your honours. <END>
our haste from hence is of so quick condition <END>
that it prefers itself and leaves unquestion'd <END>
matters of needful value. we shall write to you, <END>
as time and our concernings shall importune, <END>
how it goes with us, and do look to know <END>
what doth befall you here. so, fare you well; <END>
to the hopeful execution do i leave you <END>
of your commissions. <END>
yet give leave, my lord, <END>
that we may bring you something on the way. <END>
my haste may not admit it; <END>
nor need you, on mine honour, have to do <END>
with any scruple; your scope is as mine own <END>
so to enforce or qualify the laws <END>
as to your soul seems good. give me your hand: <END>
i'll privily away. i love the people, <END>
but do not like to stage me to their eyes: <END>
through it do well, i do not relish well <END>
their loud applause and aves vehement; <END>
nor do i think the man of safe discretion <END>
that does affect it. once more, fare you well. <END>
the heavens give safety to your purposes! <END>
lead forth and bring you back in happiness! <END>
i thank you. fare you well. <END>
i shall desire you, sir, to give me leave <END>
to have free speech with you; and it concerns me <END>
to look into the bottom of my place: <END>
a power i have, but of what strength and nature <END>
i am not yet instructed. <END>
'tis so with me. let us withdraw together, <END>
and we may soon our satisfaction have <END>
touching that point. <END>
i'll wait upon your honour. <END>
if the duke with the other dukes come not to <END>
composition with the king of hungary, why then all <END>
the dukes fall upon the king. <END>
heaven grant us its peace, but not the king of <END>
hungary's! <END>
amen. <END>
thou concludest like the sanctimonious pirate, that <END>
went to sea with the ten commandments, but scraped <END>
one out of the table. <END>
'thou shalt not steal'? <END>
ay, that he razed. <END>
why, 'twas a commandment to command the captain and <END>
all the rest from their functions: they put forth <END>
to steal. there's not a soldier of us all, that, in <END>
the thanksgiving before meat, do relish the petition <END>
well that prays for peace. <END>
i never heard any soldier dislike it. <END>
i believe thee; for i think thou never wast where <END>
grace was said. <END>
no? a dozen times at least. <END>
what, in metre? <END>
in any proportion or in any language. <END>
i think, or in any religion. <END>
ay, why not? grace is grace, despite of all <END>
controversy: as, for example, thou thyself art a <END>
wicked villain, despite of all grace. <END>
well, there went but a pair of shears between us. <END>
i grant; as there may between the lists and the <END>
velvet. thou art the list. <END>
and thou the velvet: thou art good velvet; thou'rt <END>
a three-piled piece, i warrant thee: i had as lief <END>
be a list of an english kersey as be piled, as thou <END>
art piled, for a french velvet. do i speak <END>
feelingly now? <END>
i think thou dost; and, indeed, with most painful <END>
feeling of thy speech: i will, out of thine own <END>
confession, learn to begin thy health; but, whilst i <END>
live, forget to drink after thee. <END>
i think i have done myself wrong, have i not? <END>
yes, that thou hast, whether thou art tainted or free. <END>
behold, behold. where madam mitigation comes! i <END>
have purchased as many diseases under her roof as come to-- <END>
to what, i pray? <END>
judge. <END>
to three thousand dolours a year. <END>
ay, and more. <END>
a french crown more. <END>
thou art always figuring diseases in me; but thou <END>
art full of error; i am sound. <END>
nay, not as one would say, healthy; but so sound as <END>
things that are hollow: thy bones are hollow; <END>
impiety has made a feast of thee. <END>
how now! which of your hips has the most profound sciatica? <END>
well, well; there's one yonder arrested and carried <END>
to prison was worth five thousand of you all. <END>
who's that, i pray thee? <END>
marry, sir, that's claudio, signior claudio. <END>
claudio to prison? 'tis not so. <END>
nay, but i know 'tis so: i saw him arrested, saw <END>
him carried away; and, which is more, within these <END>
three days his head to be chopped off. <END>
but, after all this fooling, i would not have it so. <END>
art thou sure of this? <END>
i am too sure of it: and it is for getting madam <END>
julietta with child. <END>
believe me, this may be: he promised to meet me two <END>
hours since, and he was ever precise in <END>
promise-keeping. <END>
besides, you know, it draws something near to the <END>
speech we had to such a purpose. <END>
but, most of all, agreeing with the proclamation. <END>
away! let's go learn the truth of it. <END>
thus, what with the war, what with the sweat, what <END>
with the gallows and what with poverty, i am <END>
custom-shrunk. <END>
how now! what's the news with you? <END>
yonder man is carried to prison. <END>
well; what has he done? <END>
a woman. <END>
but what's his offence? <END>
groping for trouts in a peculiar river. <END>
what, is there a maid with child by him? <END>
no, but there's a woman with maid by him. you have <END>
not heard of the proclamation, have you? <END>
what proclamation, man? <END>
all houses in the suburbs of vienna must be plucked down. <END>
and what shall become of those in the city? <END>
they shall stand for seed: they had gone down too, <END>
but that a wise burgher put in for them. <END>
but shall all our houses of resort in the suburbs be <END>
pulled down? <END>
to the ground, mistress. <END>
why, here's a change indeed in the commonwealth! <END>
what shall become of me? <END>
come; fear you not: good counsellors lack no <END>
clients: though you change your place, you need not <END>
change your trade; i'll be your tapster still. <END>
courage! there will be pity taken on you: you that <END>
have worn your eyes almost out in the service, you <END>
will be considered. <END>
what's to do here, thomas tapster? let's withdraw. <END>
here comes signior claudio, led by the provost to <END>
prison; and there's madam juliet. <END>
fellow, why dost thou show me thus to the world? <END>
bear me to prison, where i am committed. <END>
i do it not in evil disposition, <END>
but from lord angelo by special charge. <END>
thus can the demigod authority <END>
make us pay down for our offence by weight <END>
the words of heaven; on whom it will, it will; <END>
on whom it will not, so; yet still 'tis just. <END>
why, how now, claudio! whence comes this restraint? <END>
from too much liberty, my lucio, liberty: <END>
as surfeit is the father of much fast, <END>
so every scope by the immoderate use <END>
turns to restraint. our natures do pursue, <END>
like rats that ravin down their proper bane, <END>
a thirsty evil; and when we drink we die. <END>
if could speak so wisely under an arrest, i would <END>
send for certain of my creditors: and yet, to say <END>
the truth, i had as lief have the foppery of freedom <END>
as the morality of imprisonment. what's thy <END>
offence, claudio? <END>
what but to speak of would offend again. <END>
what, is't murder? <END>
no. <END>
lechery? <END>
call it so. <END>
away, sir! you must go. <END>
one word, good friend. lucio, a word with you. <END>
a hundred, if they'll do you any good. <END>
is lechery so look'd after? <END>
thus stands it with me: upon a true contract <END>
i got possession of julietta's bed: <END>
you know the lady; she is fast my wife, <END>
save that we do the denunciation lack <END>
of outward order: this we came not to, <END>
only for propagation of a dower <END>
remaining in the coffer of her friends, <END>
from whom we thought it meet to hide our love <END>
till time had made them for us. but it chances <END>
the stealth of our most mutual entertainment <END>
with character too gross is writ on juliet. <END>
with child, perhaps? <END>
unhappily, even so. <END>
and the new deputy now for the duke-- <END>
whether it be the fault and glimpse of newness, <END>
or whether that the body public be <END>
a horse whereon the governor doth ride, <END>
who, newly in the seat, that it may know <END>
he can command, lets it straight feel the spur; <END>
whether the tyranny be in his place, <END>
or in his emmence that fills it up, <END>
i stagger in:--but this new governor <END>
awakes me all the enrolled penalties <END>
which have, like unscour'd armour, hung by the wall <END>
so long that nineteen zodiacs have gone round <END>
and none of them been worn; and, for a name, <END>
now puts the drowsy and neglected act <END>
freshly on me: 'tis surely for a name. <END>
i warrant it is: and thy head stands so tickle on <END>
thy shoulders that a milkmaid, if she be in love, <END>
may sigh it off. send after the duke and appeal to <END>
him. <END>
i have done so, but he's not to be found. <END>
i prithee, lucio, do me this kind service: <END>
this day my sister should the cloister enter <END>
and there receive her approbation: <END>
acquaint her with the danger of my state: <END>
implore her, in my voice, that she make friends <END>
to the strict deputy; bid herself assay him: <END>
i have great hope in that; for in her youth <END>
there is a prone and speechless dialect, <END>
such as move men; beside, she hath prosperous art <END>
when she will play with reason and discourse, <END>
and well she can persuade. <END>
i pray she may; as well for the encouragement of the <END>
like, which else would stand under grievous <END>
imposition, as for the enjoying of thy life, who i <END>
would be sorry should be thus foolishly lost at a <END>
game of tick-tack. i'll to her. <END>
i thank you, good friend lucio. <END>
within two hours. <END>
come, officer, away! <END>
no, holy father; throw away that thought; <END>
believe not that the dribbling dart of love <END>
can pierce a complete bosom. why i desire thee <END>
to give me secret harbour, hath a purpose <END>
more grave and wrinkled than the aims and ends <END>
of burning youth. <END>
may your grace speak of it? <END>
my holy sir, none better knows than you <END>
how i have ever loved the life removed <END>
and held in idle price to haunt assemblies <END>
where youth, and cost, and witless bravery keeps. <END>
i have deliver'd to lord angelo, <END>
a man of stricture and firm abstinence, <END>
my absolute power and place here in vienna, <END>
and he supposes me travell'd to poland; <END>
for so i have strew'd it in the common ear, <END>
and so it is received. now, pious sir, <END>
you will demand of me why i do this? <END>
gladly, my lord. <END>
we have strict statutes and most biting laws. <END>
the needful bits and curbs to headstrong weeds, <END>
which for this nineteen years we have let slip; <END>
even like an o'ergrown lion in a cave, <END>
that goes not out to prey. now, as fond fathers, <END>
having bound up the threatening twigs of birch, <END>
only to stick it in their children's sight <END>
for terror, not to use, in time the rod <END>
becomes more mock'd than fear'd; so our decrees, <END>
dead to infliction, to themselves are dead; <END>
and liberty plucks justice by the nose; <END>
the baby beats the nurse, and quite athwart <END>
goes all decorum. <END>
it rested in your grace <END>
to unloose this tied-up justice when you pleased: <END>
and it in you more dreadful would have seem'd <END>
than in lord angelo. <END>
i do fear, too dreadful: <END>
sith 'twas my fault to give the people scope, <END>
'twould be my tyranny to strike and gall them <END>
for what i bid them do: for we bid this be done, <END>
when evil deeds have their permissive pass <END>
and not the punishment. therefore indeed, my father, <END>
i have on angelo imposed the office; <END>
who may, in the ambush of my name, strike home, <END>
and yet my nature never in the fight <END>
to do in slander. and to behold his sway, <END>
i will, as 'twere a brother of your order, <END>
visit both prince and people: therefore, i prithee, <END>
supply me with the habit and instruct me <END>
how i may formally in person bear me <END>
like a true friar. more reasons for this action <END>
at our more leisure shall i render you; <END>
only, this one: lord angelo is precise; <END>
stands at a guard with envy; scarce confesses <END>
that his blood flows, or that his appetite <END>
is more to bread than stone: hence shall we see, <END>
if power change purpose, what our seemers be. <END>
and have you nuns no farther privileges? <END>
are not these large enough? <END>
yes, truly; i speak not as desiring more; <END>
but rather wishing a more strict restraint <END>
upon the sisterhood, the votarists of saint clare. <END>
who's that which calls? <END>
it is a man's voice. gentle isabella, <END>
turn you the key, and know his business of him; <END>
you may, i may not; you are yet unsworn. <END>
when you have vow'd, you must not speak with men <END>
but in the presence of the prioress: <END>
then, if you speak, you must not show your face, <END>
or, if you show your face, you must not speak. <END>
he calls again; i pray you, answer him. <END>
peace and prosperity! who is't that calls <END>
hail, virgin, if you be, as those cheek-roses <END>
proclaim you are no less! can you so stead me <END>
as bring me to the sight of isabella, <END>
a novice of this place and the fair sister <END>
to her unhappy brother claudio? <END>
why 'her unhappy brother'? let me ask, <END>
the rather for i now must make you know <END>
i am that isabella and his sister. <END>
gentle and fair, your brother kindly greets you: <END>
not to be weary with you, he's in prison. <END>
woe me! for what? <END>
for that which, if myself might be his judge, <END>
he should receive his punishment in thanks: <END>
he hath got his friend with child. <END>
sir, make me not your story. <END>
it is true. <END>
i would not--though 'tis my familiar sin <END>
with maids to seem the lapwing and to jest, <END>
tongue far from heart--play with all virgins so: <END>
i hold you as a thing ensky'd and sainted. <END>
by your renouncement an immortal spirit, <END>
and to be talk'd with in sincerity, <END>
as with a saint. <END>
you do blaspheme the good in mocking me. <END>
do not believe it. fewness and truth, 'tis thus: <END>
your brother and his lover have embraced: <END>
as those that feed grow full, as blossoming time <END>
that from the seedness the bare fallow brings <END>
to teeming foison, even so her plenteous womb <END>
expresseth his full tilth and husbandry. <END>
some one with child by him? my cousin juliet? <END>
is she your cousin? <END>
adoptedly; as school-maids change their names <END>
by vain though apt affection. <END>
she it is. <END>
o, let him marry her. <END>
this is the point. <END>
the duke is very strangely gone from hence; <END>
bore many gentlemen, myself being one, <END>
in hand and hope of action: but we do learn <END>
by those that know the very nerves of state, <END>
his givings-out were of an infinite distance <END>
from his true-meant design. upon his place, <END>
and with full line of his authority, <END>
governs lord angelo; a man whose blood <END>
is very snow-broth; one who never feels <END>
the wanton stings and motions of the sense, <END>
but doth rebate and blunt his natural edge <END>
with profits of the mind, study and fast. <END>
he--to give fear to use and liberty, <END>
which have for long run by the hideous law, <END>
as mice by lions--hath pick'd out an act, <END>
under whose heavy sense your brother's life <END>
falls into forfeit: he arrests him on it; <END>
and follows close the rigour of the statute, <END>
to make him an example. all hope is gone, <END>
unless you have the grace by your fair prayer <END>
to soften angelo: and that's my pith of business <END>
'twixt you and your poor brother. <END>
doth he so seek his life? <END>
has censured him <END>
already; and, as i hear, the provost hath <END>
a warrant for his execution. <END>
alas! what poor ability's in me <END>
to do him good? <END>
assay the power you have. <END>
my power? alas, i doubt-- <END>
our doubts are traitors <END>
and make us lose the good we oft might win <END>
by fearing to attempt. go to lord angelo, <END>
and let him learn to know, when maidens sue, <END>
men give like gods; but when they weep and kneel, <END>
all their petitions are as freely theirs <END>
as they themselves would owe them. <END>
i'll see what i can do. <END>
but speedily. <END>
i will about it straight; <END>
no longer staying but to give the mother <END>
notice of my affair. i humbly thank you: <END>
commend me to my brother: soon at night <END>
i'll send him certain word of my success. <END>
i take my leave of you. <END>
good sir, adieu. <END>
we must not make a scarecrow of the law, <END>
setting it up to fear the birds of prey, <END>
and let it keep one shape, till custom make it <END>
their perch and not their terror. <END>
ay, but yet <END>
let us be keen, and rather cut a little, <END>
than fall, and bruise to death. alas, this gentleman <END>
whom i would save, had a most noble father! <END>
let but your honour know, <END>
whom i believe to be most strait in virtue, <END>
that, in the working of your own affections, <END>
had time cohered with place or place with wishing, <END>
or that the resolute acting of your blood <END>
could have attain'd the effect of your own purpose, <END>
whether you had not sometime in your life <END>
err'd in this point which now you censure him, <END>
and pull'd the law upon you. <END>
'tis one thing to be tempted, escalus, <END>
another thing to fall. i not deny, <END>
the jury, passing on the prisoner's life, <END>
may in the sworn twelve have a thief or two <END>
guiltier than him they try. what's open made to justice, <END>
that justice seizes: what know the laws <END>
that thieves do pass on thieves? 'tis very pregnant, <END>
the jewel that we find, we stoop and take't <END>
because we see it; but what we do not see <END>
we tread upon, and never think of it. <END>
you may not so extenuate his offence <END>
for i have had such faults; but rather tell me, <END>
when i, that censure him, do so offend, <END>
let mine own judgment pattern out my death, <END>
and nothing come in partial. sir, he must die. <END>
be it as your wisdom will. <END>
where is the provost? <END>
here, if it like your honour. <END>
see that claudio <END>
be executed by nine to-morrow morning: <END>
bring him his confessor, let him be prepared; <END>
for that's the utmost of his pilgrimage. <END>
come, bring them away: if these be good people in <END>
a commonweal that do nothing but use their abuses in <END>
common houses, i know no law: bring them away. <END>
how now, sir! what's your name? and what's the matter? <END>
if it please your honour, i am the poor duke's <END>
constable, and my name is elbow: i do lean upon <END>
justice, sir, and do bring in here before your good <END>
honour two notorious benefactors. <END>
benefactors? well; what benefactors are they? are <END>
they not malefactors? <END>
if it? please your honour, i know not well what they <END>
are: but precise villains they are, that i am sure <END>
of; and void of all profanation in the world that <END>
good christians ought to have. <END>
this comes off well; here's a wise officer. <END>
go to: what quality are they of? elbow is your <END>
name? why dost thou not speak, elbow? <END>
he cannot, sir; he's out at elbow. <END>
what are you, sir? <END>
he, sir! a tapster, sir; parcel-bawd; one that <END>
serves a bad woman; whose house, sir, was, as they <END>
say, plucked down in the suburbs; and now she <END>
professes a hot-house, which, i think, is a very ill house too. <END>
how know you that? <END>
my wife, sir, whom i detest before heaven and your honour,-- <END>
how? thy wife? <END>
ay, sir; whom, i thank heaven, is an honest woman,-- <END>
dost thou detest her therefore? <END>
i say, sir, i will detest myself also, as well as <END>
she, that this house, if it be not a bawd's house, <END>
it is pity of her life, for it is a naughty house. <END>
how dost thou know that, constable? <END>
marry, sir, by my wife; who, if she had been a woman <END>
cardinally given, might have been accused in <END>
fornication, adultery, and all uncleanliness there. <END>
by the woman's means? <END>
ay, sir, by mistress overdone's means: but as she <END>
spit in his face, so she defied him. <END>
sir, if it please your honour, this is not so. <END>
prove it before these varlets here, thou honourable <END>
man; prove it. <END>
do you hear how he misplaces? <END>
sir, she came in great with child; and longing, <END>
saving your honour's reverence, for stewed prunes; <END>
sir, we had but two in the house, which at that very <END>
distant time stood, as it were, in a fruit-dish, a <END>
dish of some three-pence; your honours have seen <END>
such dishes; they are not china dishes, but very <END>
good dishes,-- <END>
go to, go to: no matter for the dish, sir. <END>
no, indeed, sir, not of a pin; you are therein in <END>
the right: but to the point. as i say, this <END>
mistress elbow, being, as i say, with child, and <END>
being great-bellied, and longing, as i said, for <END>
prunes; and having but two in the dish, as i said, <END>
master froth here, this very man, having eaten the <END>
rest, as i said, and, as i say, paying for them very <END>
honestly; for, as you know, master froth, i could <END>
not give you three-pence again. <END>
no, indeed. <END>
very well: you being then, if you be remembered, <END>
cracking the stones of the foresaid prunes,-- <END>
ay, so i did indeed. <END>
why, very well; i telling you then, if you be <END>
remembered, that such a one and such a one were past <END>
cure of the thing you wot of, unless they kept very <END>
good diet, as i told you,-- <END>
all this is true. <END>
why, very well, then,-- <END>
come, you are a tedious fool: to the purpose. what <END>
was done to elbow's wife, that he hath cause to <END>
complain of? come me to what was done to her. <END>
sir, your honour cannot come to that yet. <END>
no, sir, nor i mean it not. <END>
sir, but you shall come to it, by your honour's <END>
leave. and, i beseech you, look into master froth <END>
here, sir; a man of four-score pound a year; whose <END>
father died at hallowmas: was't not at hallowmas, <END>
master froth? <END>
all-hallond eve. <END>
why, very well; i hope here be truths. he, sir, <END>
sitting, as i say, in a lower chair, sir; 'twas in <END>
the bunch of grapes, where indeed you have a delight <END>
to sit, have you not? <END>
i have so; because it is an open room and good for winter. <END>
why, very well, then; i hope here be truths. <END>
this will last out a night in russia, <END>
when nights are longest there: i'll take my leave. <END>
and leave you to the hearing of the cause; <END>
hoping you'll find good cause to whip them all. <END>
i think no less. good morrow to your lordship. <END>
now, sir, come on: what was done to elbow's wife, once more? <END>
once, sir? there was nothing done to her once. <END>
i beseech you, sir, ask him what this man did to my wife. <END>
i beseech your honour, ask me. <END>
well, sir; what did this gentleman to her? <END>
i beseech you, sir, look in this gentleman's face. <END>
good master froth, look upon his honour; 'tis for a <END>
good purpose. doth your honour mark his face? <END>
ay, sir, very well. <END>
nay; i beseech you, mark it well. <END>
well, i do so. <END>
doth your honour see any harm in his face? <END>
why, no. <END>
i'll be supposed upon a book, his face is the worst <END>
thing about him. good, then; if his face be the <END>
worst thing about him, how could master froth do the <END>
constable's wife any harm? i would know that of <END>
your honour. <END>
he's in the right. constable, what say you to it? <END>
first, an it like you, the house is a respected <END>
house; next, this is a respected fellow; and his <END>
mistress is a respected woman. <END>
by this hand, sir, his wife is a more respected <END>
person than any of us all. <END>
varlet, thou liest; thou liest, wicked varlet! the <END>
time has yet to come that she was ever respected <END>
with man, woman, or child. <END>
sir, she was respected with him before he married with her. <END>
which is the wiser here? justice or iniquity? is <END>
this true? <END>
o thou caitiff! o thou varlet! o thou wicked <END>
hannibal! i respected with her before i was married <END>
to her! if ever i was respected with her, or she <END>
with me, let not your worship think me the poor <END>
duke's officer. prove this, thou wicked hannibal, or <END>
i'll have mine action of battery on thee. <END>
if he took you a box o' the ear, you might have your <END>
action of slander too. <END>
marry, i thank your good worship for it. what is't <END>
your worship's pleasure i shall do with this wicked caitiff? <END>
truly, officer, because he hath some offences in him <END>
that thou wouldst discover if thou couldst, let him <END>
continue in his courses till thou knowest what they <END>
are. <END>
marry, i thank your worship for it. thou seest, thou <END>
wicked varlet, now, what's come upon thee: thou art <END>
to continue now, thou varlet; thou art to continue. <END>
where were you born, friend? <END>
here in vienna, sir. <END>
are you of fourscore pounds a year? <END>
yes, an't please you, sir. <END>
so. what trade are you of, sir? <END>
tapster; a poor widow's tapster. <END>
your mistress' name? <END>
mistress overdone. <END>
hath she had any more than one husband? <END>
nine, sir; overdone by the last. <END>
nine! come hither to me, master froth. master <END>
froth, i would not have you acquainted with <END>
tapsters: they will draw you, master froth, and you <END>
will hang them. get you gone, and let me hear no <END>
more of you. <END>
i thank your worship. for mine own part, i never <END>
come into any room in a tap-house, but i am drawn <END>
in. <END>
well, no more of it, master froth: farewell. <END>
come you hither to me, master tapster. what's your <END>
name, master tapster? <END>
pompey. <END>
what else? <END>
bum, sir. <END>
troth, and your bum is the greatest thing about you; <END>
so that in the beastliest sense you are pompey the <END>
great. pompey, you are partly a bawd, pompey, <END>
howsoever you colour it in being a tapster, are you <END>
not? come, tell me true: it shall be the better for you. <END>
truly, sir, i am a poor fellow that would live. <END>
how would you live, pompey? by being a bawd? what <END>
do you think of the trade, pompey? is it a lawful trade? <END>
if the law would allow it, sir. <END>
but the law will not allow it, pompey; nor it shall <END>
not be allowed in vienna. <END>
does your worship mean to geld and splay all the <END>
youth of the city? <END>
no, pompey. <END>
truly, sir, in my poor opinion, they will to't then. <END>
if your worship will take order for the drabs and <END>
the knaves, you need not to fear the bawds. <END>
there are pretty orders beginning, i can tell you: <END>
it is but heading and hanging. <END>
if you head and hang all that offend that way but <END>
for ten year together, you'll be glad to give out a <END>
commission for more heads: if this law hold in <END>
vienna ten year, i'll rent the fairest house in it <END>
after three-pence a bay: if you live to see this <END>
come to pass, say pompey told you so. <END>
thank you, good pompey; and, in requital of your <END>
prophecy, hark you: i advise you, let me not find <END>
you before me again upon any complaint whatsoever; <END>
no, not for dwelling where you do: if i do, pompey, <END>
i shall beat you to your tent, and prove a shrewd <END>
caesar to you; in plain dealing, pompey, i shall <END>
have you whipt: so, for this time, pompey, fare you well. <END>
i thank your worship for your good counsel: <END>
but i shall follow it as the flesh and fortune shall <END>
better determine. <END>
whip me? no, no; let carman whip his jade: <END>
the valiant heart is not whipt out of his trade. <END>
come hither to me, master elbow; come hither, master <END>
constable. how long have you been in this place of constable? <END>
seven year and a half, sir. <END>
i thought, by your readiness in the office, you had <END>
continued in it some time. you say, seven years together? <END>
and a half, sir. <END>
alas, it hath been great pains to you. they do you <END>
wrong to put you so oft upon 't: are there not men <END>
in your ward sufficient to serve it? <END>
faith, sir, few of any wit in such matters: as they <END>
are chosen, they are glad to choose me for them; i <END>
do it for some piece of money, and go through with <END>
all. <END>
look you bring me in the names of some six or seven, <END>
the most sufficient of your parish. <END>
to your worship's house, sir? <END>
to my house. fare you well. <END>
what's o'clock, think you? <END>
eleven, sir. <END>
i pray you home to dinner with me. <END>
i humbly thank you. <END>
it grieves me for the death of claudio; <END>
but there's no remedy. <END>
lord angelo is severe. <END>
it is but needful: <END>
mercy is not itself, that oft looks so; <END>
pardon is still the nurse of second woe: <END>
but yet,--poor claudio! there is no remedy. <END>
come, sir. <END>
he's hearing of a cause; he will come straight <END>
i'll tell him of you. <END>
pray you, do. <END>
i'll know <END>
his pleasure; may be he will relent. alas, <END>
he hath but as offended in a dream! <END>
all sects, all ages smack of this vice; and he <END>
to die for't! <END>
now, what's the matter. provost? <END>
is it your will claudio shall die tomorrow? <END>
did not i tell thee yea? hadst thou not order? <END>
why dost thou ask again? <END>
lest i might be too rash: <END>
under your good correction, i have seen, <END>
when, after execution, judgment hath <END>
repented o'er his doom. <END>
go to; let that be mine: <END>
do you your office, or give up your place, <END>
and you shall well be spared. <END>
i crave your honour's pardon. <END>
what shall be done, sir, with the groaning juliet? <END>
she's very near her hour. <END>
dispose of her <END>
to some more fitter place, and that with speed. <END>
here is the sister of the man condemn'd <END>
desires access to you. <END>
hath he a sister? <END>
ay, my good lord; a very virtuous maid, <END>
and to be shortly of a sisterhood, <END>
if not already. <END>
well, let her be admitted. <END>
see you the fornicatress be removed: <END>
let have needful, but not lavish, means; <END>
there shall be order for't. <END>
god save your honour! <END>
stay a little while. <END>
you're welcome: what's your will? <END>
i am a woeful suitor to your honour, <END>
please but your honour hear me. <END>
well; what's your suit? <END>
there is a vice that most i do abhor, <END>
and most desire should meet the blow of justice; <END>
for which i would not plead, but that i must; <END>
for which i must not plead, but that i am <END>
at war 'twixt will and will not. <END>
well; the matter? <END>
i have a brother is condemn'd to die: <END>
i do beseech you, let it be his fault, <END>
and not my brother. <END>
condemn the fault and not the actor of it? <END>
why, every fault's condemn'd ere it be done: <END>
mine were the very cipher of a function, <END>
to fine the faults whose fine stands in record, <END>
and let go by the actor. <END>
o just but severe law! <END>
i had a brother, then. heaven keep your honour! <END>
must he needs die? <END>
maiden, no remedy. <END>
yes; i do think that you might pardon him, <END>
and neither heaven nor man grieve at the mercy. <END>
i will not do't. <END>
but can you, if you would? <END>
look, what i will not, that i cannot do. <END>
but might you do't, and do the world no wrong, <END>
if so your heart were touch'd with that remorse <END>
as mine is to him? <END>
he's sentenced; 'tis too late. <END>
too late? why, no; i, that do speak a word. <END>
may call it back again. well, believe this, <END>
no ceremony that to great ones 'longs, <END>
not the king's crown, nor the deputed sword, <END>
the marshal's truncheon, nor the judge's robe, <END>
become them with one half so good a grace <END>
as mercy does. <END>
if he had been as you and you as he, <END>
you would have slipt like him; but he, like you, <END>
would not have been so stern. <END>
pray you, be gone. <END>
i would to heaven i had your potency, <END>
and you were isabel! should it then be thus? <END>
no; i would tell what 'twere to be a judge, <END>
and what a prisoner. <END>
your brother is a forfeit of the law, <END>
and you but waste your words. <END>
alas, alas! <END>
why, all the souls that were were forfeit once; <END>
and he that might the vantage best have took <END>
found out the remedy. how would you be, <END>
if he, which is the top of judgment, should <END>
but judge you as you are? o, think on that; <END>
and mercy then will breathe within your lips, <END>
like man new made. <END>
be you content, fair maid; <END>
it is the law, not i condemn your brother: <END>
were he my kinsman, brother, or my son, <END>
it should be thus with him: he must die tomorrow. <END>
to-morrow! o, that's sudden! spare him, spare him! <END>
he's not prepared for death. even for our kitchens <END>
we kill the fowl of season: shall we serve heaven <END>
with less respect than we do minister <END>
to our gross selves? good, good my lord, bethink you; <END>
who is it that hath died for this offence? <END>
there's many have committed it. <END>
the law hath not been dead, though it hath slept: <END>
those many had not dared to do that evil, <END>
if the first that did the edict infringe <END>
had answer'd for his deed: now 'tis awake <END>
takes note of what is done; and, like a prophet, <END>
looks in a glass, that shows what future evils, <END>
either new, or by remissness new-conceived, <END>
and so in progress to be hatch'd and born, <END>
are now to have no successive degrees, <END>
but, ere they live, to end. <END>
yet show some pity. <END>
i show it most of all when i show justice; <END>
for then i pity those i do not know, <END>
which a dismiss'd offence would after gall; <END>
and do him right that, answering one foul wrong, <END>
lives not to act another. be satisfied; <END>
your brother dies to-morrow; be content. <END>
so you must be the first that gives this sentence, <END>
and he, that suffer's. o, it is excellent <END>
to have a giant's strength; but it is tyrannous <END>
to use it like a giant. <END>
could great men thunder <END>
as jove himself does, jove would ne'er be quiet, <END>
for every pelting, petty officer <END>
would use his heaven for thunder; <END>
nothing but thunder! merciful heaven, <END>
thou rather with thy sharp and sulphurous bolt <END>
split'st the unwedgeable and gnarled oak <END>
than the soft myrtle: but man, proud man, <END>
drest in a little brief authority, <END>
most ignorant of what he's most assured, <END>
his glassy essence, like an angry ape, <END>
plays such fantastic tricks before high heaven <END>
as make the angels weep; who, with our spleens, <END>
would all themselves laugh mortal. <END>
we cannot weigh our brother with ourself: <END>
great men may jest with saints; 'tis wit in them, <END>
but in the less foul profanation. <END>
thou'rt i' the right, girl; more o, that. <END>
that in the captain's but a choleric word, <END>
which in the soldier is flat blasphemy. <END>
why do you put these sayings upon me? <END>
because authority, though it err like others, <END>
hath yet a kind of medicine in itself, <END>
that skins the vice o' the top. go to your bosom; <END>
knock there, and ask your heart what it doth know <END>
that's like my brother's fault: if it confess <END>
a natural guiltiness such as is his, <END>
let it not sound a thought upon your tongue <END>
against my brother's life. <END>
gentle my lord, turn back. <END>
i will bethink me: come again tomorrow. <END>
hark how i'll bribe you: good my lord, turn back. <END>
how! bribe me? <END>
ay, with such gifts that heaven shall share with you. <END>
not with fond shekels of the tested gold, <END>
or stones whose rates are either rich or poor <END>
as fancy values them; but with true prayers <END>
that shall be up at heaven and enter there <END>
ere sun-rise, prayers from preserved souls, <END>
from fasting maids whose minds are dedicate <END>
to nothing temporal. <END>
well; come to me to-morrow. <END>
heaven keep your honour safe! <END>
at what hour to-morrow <END>
shall i attend your lordship? <END>
at any time 'fore noon. <END>
'save your honour! <END>
from thee, even from thy virtue! <END>
what's this, what's this? is this her fault or mine? <END>
the tempter or the tempted, who sins most? <END>
ha! <END>
not she: nor doth she tempt: but it is i <END>
that, lying by the violet in the sun, <END>
do as the carrion does, not as the flower, <END>
corrupt with virtuous season. can it be <END>
that modesty may more betray our sense <END>
than woman's lightness? having waste ground enough, <END>
shall we desire to raze the sanctuary <END>
and pitch our evils there? o, fie, fie, fie! <END>
what dost thou, or what art thou, angelo? <END>
dost thou desire her foully for those things <END>
that make her good? o, let her brother live! <END>
thieves for their robbery have authority <END>
when judges steal themselves. what, do i love her, <END>
that i desire to hear her speak again, <END>
and feast upon her eyes? what is't i dream on? <END>
o cunning enemy, that, to catch a saint, <END>
with saints dost bait thy hook! most dangerous <END>
is that temptation that doth goad us on <END>
to sin in loving virtue: never could the strumpet, <END>
with all her double vigour, art and nature, <END>
once stir my temper; but this virtuous maid <END>
subdues me quite. even till now, <END>
when men were fond, i smiled and wonder'd how. <END>
hail to you, provost! so i think you are. <END>
i am the provost. what's your will, good friar? <END>
bound by my charity and my blest order, <END>
i come to visit the afflicted spirits <END>
here in the prison. do me the common right <END>
to let me see them and to make me know <END>
the nature of their crimes, that i may minister <END>
to them accordingly. <END>
i would do more than that, if more were needful. <END>
look, here comes one: a gentlewoman of mine, <END>
who, falling in the flaws of her own youth, <END>
hath blister'd her report: she is with child; <END>
and he that got it, sentenced; a young man <END>
more fit to do another such offence <END>
than die for this. <END>
when must he die? <END>
as i do think, to-morrow. <END>
i have provided for you: stay awhile, <END>
and you shall be conducted. <END>
repent you, fair one, of the sin you carry? <END>
i do; and bear the shame most patiently. <END>
i'll teach you how you shall arraign your conscience, <END>
and try your penitence, if it be sound, <END>
or hollowly put on. <END>
i'll gladly learn. <END>
love you the man that wrong'd you? <END>
yes, as i love the woman that wrong'd him. <END>
so then it seems your most offenceful act <END>
was mutually committed? <END>
mutually. <END>
then was your sin of heavier kind than his. <END>
i do confess it, and repent it, father. <END>
'tis meet so, daughter: but lest you do repent, <END>
as that the sin hath brought you to this shame, <END>
which sorrow is always towards ourselves, not heaven, <END>
showing we would not spare heaven as we love it, <END>
but as we stand in fear,-- <END>
i do repent me, as it is an evil, <END>
and take the shame with joy. <END>
there rest. <END>
your partner, as i hear, must die to-morrow, <END>
and i am going with instruction to him. <END>
grace go with you, benedicite! <END>
must die to-morrow! o injurious love, <END>
that respites me a life, whose very comfort <END>
is still a dying horror! <END>
'tis pity of him. <END>
when i would pray and think, i think and pray <END>
to several subjects. heaven hath my empty words; <END>
whilst my invention, hearing not my tongue, <END>
anchors on isabel: heaven in my mouth, <END>
as if i did but only chew his name; <END>
and in my heart the strong and swelling evil <END>
of my conception. the state, whereon i studied <END>
is like a good thing, being often read, <END>
grown fear'd and tedious; yea, my gravity, <END>
wherein--let no man hear me--i take pride, <END>
could i with boot change for an idle plume, <END>
which the air beats for vain. o place, o form, <END>
how often dost thou with thy case, thy habit, <END>
wrench awe from fools and tie the wiser souls <END>
to thy false seeming! blood, thou art blood: <END>
let's write good angel on the devil's horn: <END>
'tis not the devil's crest. <END>
how now! who's there? <END>
one isabel, a sister, desires access to you. <END>
teach her the way. <END>
o heavens! <END>
why does my blood thus muster to my heart, <END>
making both it unable for itself, <END>
and dispossessing all my other parts <END>
of necessary fitness? <END>
so play the foolish throngs with one that swoons; <END>
come all to help him, and so stop the air <END>
by which he should revive: and even so <END>
the general, subject to a well-wish'd king, <END>
quit their own part, and in obsequious fondness <END>
crowd to his presence, where their untaught love <END>
must needs appear offence. <END>
how now, fair maid? <END>
i am come to know your pleasure. <END>
that you might know it, would much better please me <END>
than to demand what 'tis. your brother cannot live. <END>
even so. heaven keep your honour! <END>
yet may he live awhile; and, it may be, <END>
as long as you or i yet he must die. <END>
under your sentence? <END>
yea. <END>
when, i beseech you? that in his reprieve, <END>
longer or shorter, he may be so fitted <END>
that his soul sicken not. <END>
ha! fie, these filthy vices! it were as good <END>
to pardon him that hath from nature stolen <END>
a man already made, as to remit <END>
their saucy sweetness that do coin heaven's image <END>
in stamps that are forbid: 'tis all as easy <END>
falsely to take away a life true made <END>
as to put metal in restrained means <END>
to make a false one. <END>
'tis set down so in heaven, but not in earth. <END>
say you so? then i shall pose you quickly. <END>
which had you rather, that the most just law <END>
now took your brother's life; or, to redeem him, <END>
give up your body to such sweet uncleanness <END>
as she that he hath stain'd? <END>
sir, believe this, <END>
i had rather give my body than my soul. <END>
i talk not of your soul: our compell'd sins <END>
stand more for number than for accompt. <END>
how say you? <END>
nay, i'll not warrant that; for i can speak <END>
against the thing i say. answer to this: <END>
i, now the voice of the recorded law, <END>
pronounce a sentence on your brother's life: <END>
might there not be a charity in sin <END>
to save this brother's life? <END>
please you to do't, <END>
i'll take it as a peril to my soul, <END>
it is no sin at all, but charity. <END>
pleased you to do't at peril of your soul, <END>
were equal poise of sin and charity. <END>
that i do beg his life, if it be sin, <END>
heaven let me bear it! you granting of my suit, <END>
if that be sin, i'll make it my morn prayer <END>
to have it added to the faults of mine, <END>
and nothing of your answer. <END>
nay, but hear me. <END>
your sense pursues not mine: either you are ignorant, <END>
or seem so craftily; and that's not good. <END>
let me be ignorant, and in nothing good, <END>
but graciously to know i am no better. <END>
thus wisdom wishes to appear most bright <END>
when it doth tax itself; as these black masks <END>
proclaim an enshield beauty ten times louder <END>
than beauty could, display'd. but mark me; <END>
to be received plain, i'll speak more gross: <END>
your brother is to die. <END>
so. <END>
and his offence is so, as it appears, <END>
accountant to the law upon that pain. <END>
true. <END>
admit no other way to save his life,-- <END>
as i subscribe not that, nor any other, <END>
but in the loss of question,--that you, his sister, <END>
finding yourself desired of such a person, <END>
whose credit with the judge, or own great place, <END>
could fetch your brother from the manacles <END>
of the all-building law; and that there were <END>
no earthly mean to save him, but that either <END>
you must lay down the treasures of your body <END>
to this supposed, or else to let him suffer; <END>
what would you do? <END>
as much for my poor brother as myself: <END>
that is, were i under the terms of death, <END>
the impression of keen whips i'ld wear as rubies, <END>
and strip myself to death, as to a bed <END>
that longing have been sick for, ere i'ld yield <END>
my body up to shame. <END>
then must your brother die. <END>
and 'twere the cheaper way: <END>
better it were a brother died at once, <END>
than that a sister, by redeeming him, <END>
should die for ever. <END>
were not you then as cruel as the sentence <END>
that you have slander'd so? <END>
ignomy in ransom and free pardon <END>
are of two houses: lawful mercy <END>
is nothing kin to foul redemption. <END>
you seem'd of late to make the law a tyrant; <END>
and rather proved the sliding of your brother <END>
a merriment than a vice. <END>
o, pardon me, my lord; it oft falls out, <END>
to have what we would have, we speak not what we mean: <END>
i something do excuse the thing i hate, <END>
for his advantage that i dearly love. <END>
we are all frail. <END>
else let my brother die, <END>
if not a feodary, but only he <END>
owe and succeed thy weakness. <END>
nay, women are frail too. <END>
ay, as the glasses where they view themselves; <END>
which are as easy broke as they make forms. <END>
women! help heaven! men their creation mar <END>
in profiting by them. nay, call us ten times frail; <END>
for we are soft as our complexions are, <END>
and credulous to false prints. <END>
i think it well: <END>
and from this testimony of your own sex,-- <END>
since i suppose we are made to be no stronger <END>
than faults may shake our frames,--let me be bold; <END>
i do arrest your words. be that you are, <END>
that is, a woman; if you be more, you're none; <END>
if you be one, as you are well express'd <END>
by all external warrants, show it now, <END>
by putting on the destined livery. <END>
i have no tongue but one: gentle my lord, <END>
let me entreat you speak the former language. <END>
plainly conceive, i love you. <END>
my brother did love juliet, <END>
and you tell me that he shall die for it. <END>
he shall not, isabel, if you give me love. <END>
i know your virtue hath a licence in't, <END>
which seems a little fouler than it is, <END>
to pluck on others. <END>
believe me, on mine honour, <END>
my words express my purpose. <END>
ha! little honour to be much believed, <END>
and most pernicious purpose! seeming, seeming! <END>
i will proclaim thee, angelo; look for't: <END>
sign me a present pardon for my brother, <END>
or with an outstretch'd throat i'll tell the world aloud <END>
what man thou art. <END>
who will believe thee, isabel? <END>
my unsoil'd name, the austereness of my life, <END>
my vouch against you, and my place i' the state, <END>
will so your accusation overweigh, <END>
that you shall stifle in your own report <END>
and smell of calumny. i have begun, <END>
and now i give my sensual race the rein: <END>
fit thy consent to my sharp appetite; <END>
lay by all nicety and prolixious blushes, <END>
that banish what they sue for; redeem thy brother <END>
by yielding up thy body to my will; <END>
or else he must not only die the death, <END>
but thy unkindness shall his death draw out <END>
to lingering sufferance. answer me to-morrow, <END>
or, by the affection that now guides me most, <END>
i'll prove a tyrant to him. as for you, <END>
say what you can, my false o'erweighs your true. <END>
to whom should i complain? did i tell this, <END>
who would believe me? o perilous mouths, <END>
that bear in them one and the self-same tongue, <END>
either of condemnation or approof; <END>
bidding the law make court'sy to their will: <END>
hooking both right and wrong to the appetite, <END>
to follow as it draws! i'll to my brother: <END>
though he hath fallen by prompture of the blood, <END>
yet hath he in him such a mind of honour. <END>
that, had he twenty heads to tender down <END>
on twenty bloody blocks, he'ld yield them up, <END>
before his sister should her body stoop <END>
to such abhorr'd pollution. <END>
then, isabel, live chaste, and, brother, die: <END>
more than our brother is our chastity. <END>
i'll tell him yet of angelo's request, <END>
and fit his mind to death, for his soul's rest. <END>
so then you hope of pardon from lord angelo? <END>
the miserable have no other medicine <END>
but only hope: <END>
i've hope to live, and am prepared to die. <END>
be absolute for death; either death or life <END>
shall thereby be the sweeter. reason thus with life: <END>
if i do lose thee, i do lose a thing <END>
that none but fools would keep: a breath thou art, <END>
servile to all the skyey influences, <END>
that dost this habitation, where thou keep'st, <END>
hourly afflict: merely, thou art death's fool; <END>
for him thou labour'st by thy flight to shun <END>
and yet runn'st toward him still. thou art not noble; <END>
for all the accommodations that thou bear'st <END>
are nursed by baseness. thou'rt by no means valiant; <END>
for thou dost fear the soft and tender fork <END>
of a poor worm. thy best of rest is sleep, <END>
and that thou oft provokest; yet grossly fear'st <END>
thy death, which is no more. thou art not thyself; <END>
for thou exist'st on many a thousand grains <END>
that issue out of dust. happy thou art not; <END>
for what thou hast not, still thou strivest to get, <END>
and what thou hast, forget'st. thou art not certain; <END>
for thy complexion shifts to strange effects, <END>
after the moon. if thou art rich, thou'rt poor; <END>
for, like an ass whose back with ingots bows, <END>
thou bear's thy heavy riches but a journey, <END>
and death unloads thee. friend hast thou none; <END>
for thine own bowels, which do call thee sire, <END>
the mere effusion of thy proper loins, <END>
do curse the gout, serpigo, and the rheum, <END>
for ending thee no sooner. thou hast nor youth nor age, <END>
but, as it were, an after-dinner's sleep, <END>
dreaming on both; for all thy blessed youth <END>
becomes as aged, and doth beg the alms <END>
of palsied eld; and when thou art old and rich, <END>
thou hast neither heat, affection, limb, nor beauty, <END>
to make thy riches pleasant. what's yet in this <END>
that bears the name of life? yet in this life <END>
lie hid moe thousand deaths: yet death we fear, <END>
that makes these odds all even. <END>
i humbly thank you. <END>
to sue to live, i find i seek to die; <END>
and, seeking death, find life: let it come on. <END>
who's there? come in: the wish deserves a welcome. <END>
dear sir, ere long i'll visit you again. <END>
most holy sir, i thank you. <END>
my business is a word or two with claudio. <END>
and very welcome. look, signior, here's your sister. <END>
provost, a word with you. <END>
as many as you please. <END>
bring me to hear them speak, where i may be concealed. <END>
now, sister, what's the comfort? <END>
why, <END>
as all comforts are; most good, most good indeed. <END>
lord angelo, having affairs to heaven, <END>
intends you for his swift ambassador, <END>
where you shall be an everlasting leiger: <END>
therefore your best appointment make with speed; <END>
to-morrow you set on. <END>
is there no remedy? <END>
none, but such remedy as, to save a head, <END>
to cleave a heart in twain. <END>
but is there any? <END>
yes, brother, you may live: <END>
there is a devilish mercy in the judge, <END>
if you'll implore it, that will free your life, <END>
but fetter you till death. <END>
perpetual durance? <END>
ay, just; perpetual durance, a restraint, <END>
though all the world's vastidity you had, <END>
to a determined scope. <END>
but in what nature? <END>
in such a one as, you consenting to't, <END>
would bark your honour from that trunk you bear, <END>
and leave you naked. <END>
let me know the point. <END>
o, i do fear thee, claudio; and i quake, <END>
lest thou a feverous life shouldst entertain, <END>
and six or seven winters more respect <END>
than a perpetual honour. darest thou die? <END>
the sense of death is most in apprehension; <END>
and the poor beetle, that we tread upon, <END>
in corporal sufferance finds a pang as great <END>
as when a giant dies. <END>
why give you me this shame? <END>
think you i can a resolution fetch <END>
from flowery tenderness? if i must die, <END>
i will encounter darkness as a bride, <END>
and hug it in mine arms. <END>
there spake my brother; there my father's grave <END>
did utter forth a voice. yes, thou must die: <END>
thou art too noble to conserve a life <END>
in base appliances. this outward-sainted deputy, <END>
whose settled visage and deliberate word <END>
nips youth i' the head and follies doth emmew <END>
as falcon doth the fowl, is yet a devil <END>
his filth within being cast, he would appear <END>
a pond as deep as hell. <END>
the prenzie angelo! <END>
o, 'tis the cunning livery of hell, <END>
the damned'st body to invest and cover <END>
in prenzie guards! dost thou think, claudio? <END>
if i would yield him my virginity, <END>
thou mightst be freed. <END>
o heavens! it cannot be. <END>
yes, he would give't thee, from this rank offence, <END>
so to offend him still. this night's the time <END>
that i should do what i abhor to name, <END>
or else thou diest to-morrow. <END>
thou shalt not do't. <END>
o, were it but my life, <END>
i'ld throw it down for your deliverance <END>
as frankly as a pin. <END>
thanks, dear isabel. <END>
be ready, claudio, for your death tomorrow. <END>
yes. has he affections in him, <END>
that thus can make him bite the law by the nose, <END>
when he would force it? sure, it is no sin, <END>
or of the deadly seven, it is the least. <END>
which is the least? <END>
if it were damnable, he being so wise, <END>
why would he for the momentary trick <END>
be perdurably fined? o isabel! <END>
what says my brother? <END>
death is a fearful thing. <END>
and shamed life a hateful. <END>
ay, but to die, and go we know not where; <END>
to lie in cold obstruction and to rot; <END>
this sensible warm motion to become <END>
a kneaded clod; and the delighted spirit <END>
to bathe in fiery floods, or to reside <END>
in thrilling region of thick-ribbed ice; <END>
to be imprison'd in the viewless winds, <END>
and blown with restless violence round about <END>
the pendent world; or to be worse than worst <END>
of those that lawless and incertain thought <END>
imagine howling: 'tis too horrible! <END>
the weariest and most loathed worldly life <END>
that age, ache, penury and imprisonment <END>
can lay on nature is a paradise <END>
to what we fear of death. <END>
alas, alas! <END>
sweet sister, let me live: <END>
what sin you do to save a brother's life, <END>
nature dispenses with the deed so far <END>
that it becomes a virtue. <END>
o you beast! <END>
o faithless coward! o dishonest wretch! <END>
wilt thou be made a man out of my vice? <END>
is't not a kind of incest, to take life <END>
from thine own sister's shame? what should i think? <END>
heaven shield my mother play'd my father fair! <END>
for such a warped slip of wilderness <END>
ne'er issued from his blood. take my defiance! <END>
die, perish! might but my bending down <END>
reprieve thee from thy fate, it should proceed: <END>
i'll pray a thousand prayers for thy death, <END>
no word to save thee. <END>
nay, hear me, isabel. <END>
o, fie, fie, fie! <END>
thy sin's not accidental, but a trade. <END>
mercy to thee would prove itself a bawd: <END>
'tis best thou diest quickly. <END>
o hear me, isabella! <END>
vouchsafe a word, young sister, but one word. <END>
what is your will? <END>
might you dispense with your leisure, i would by and <END>
by have some speech with you: the satisfaction i <END>
would require is likewise your own benefit. <END>
i have no superfluous leisure; my stay must be <END>
stolen out of other affairs; but i will attend you awhile. <END>
son, i have overheard what hath passed between you <END>
and your sister. angelo had never the purpose to <END>
corrupt her; only he hath made an essay of her <END>
virtue to practise his judgment with the disposition <END>
of natures: she, having the truth of honour in her, <END>
hath made him that gracious denial which he is most <END>
glad to receive. i am confessor to angelo, and i <END>
know this to be true; therefore prepare yourself to <END>
death: do not satisfy your resolution with hopes <END>
that are fallible: tomorrow you must die; go to <END>
your knees and make ready. <END>
let me ask my sister pardon. i am so out of love <END>
with life that i will sue to be rid of it. <END>
hold you there: farewell. <END>
provost, a word with you! <END>
what's your will, father <END>
that now you are come, you will be gone. leave me <END>
awhile with the maid: my mind promises with my <END>
habit no loss shall touch her by my company. <END>
in good time. <END>
the hand that hath made you fair hath made you good: <END>
the goodness that is cheap in beauty makes beauty <END>
brief in goodness; but grace, being the soul of <END>
your complexion, shall keep the body of it ever <END>
fair. the assault that angelo hath made to you, <END>
fortune hath conveyed to my understanding; and, but <END>
that frailty hath examples for his falling, i should <END>
wonder at angelo. how will you do to content this <END>
substitute, and to save your brother? <END>
i am now going to resolve him: i had rather my <END>
brother die by the law than my son should be <END>
unlawfully born. but, o, how much is the good duke <END>
deceived in angelo! if ever he return and i can <END>
speak to him, i will open my lips in vain, or <END>
discover his government. <END>
that shall not be much amiss: yet, as the matter <END>
now stands, he will avoid your accusation; he made <END>
trial of you only. therefore fasten your ear on my <END>
advisings: to the love i have in doing good a <END>
remedy presents itself. i do make myself believe <END>
that you may most uprighteously do a poor wronged <END>
lady a merited benefit; redeem your brother from <END>
the angry law; do no stain to your own gracious <END>
person; and much please the absent duke, if <END>
peradventure he shall ever return to have hearing of <END>
this business. <END>
let me hear you speak farther. i have spirit to do <END>
anything that appears not foul in the truth of my spirit. <END>
virtue is bold, and goodness never fearful. have <END>
you not heard speak of mariana, the sister of <END>
frederick the great soldier who miscarried at sea? <END>
i have heard of the lady, and good words went with her name. <END>
she should this angelo have married; was affianced <END>
to her by oath, and the nuptial appointed: between <END>
which time of the contract and limit of the <END>
solemnity, her brother frederick was wrecked at sea, <END>
having in that perished vessel the dowry of his <END>
sister. but mark how heavily this befell to the <END>
poor gentlewoman: there she lost a noble and <END>
renowned brother, in his love toward her ever most <END>
kind and natural; with him, the portion and sinew of <END>
her fortune, her marriage-dowry; with both, her <END>
combinate husband, this well-seeming angelo. <END>
can this be so? did angelo so leave her? <END>
left her in her tears, and dried not one of them <END>
with his comfort; swallowed his vows whole, <END>
pretending in her discoveries of dishonour: in few, <END>
bestowed her on her own lamentation, which she yet <END>
wears for his sake; and he, a marble to her tears, <END>
is washed with them, but relents not. <END>
what a merit were it in death to take this poor maid <END>
from the world! what corruption in this life, that <END>
it will let this man live! but how out of this can she avail? <END>
it is a rupture that you may easily heal: and the <END>
cure of it not only saves your brother, but keeps <END>
you from dishonour in doing it. <END>
show me how, good father. <END>
this forenamed maid hath yet in her the continuance <END>
of her first affection: his unjust unkindness, that <END>
in all reason should have quenched her love, hath, <END>
like an impediment in the current, made it more <END>
violent and unruly. go you to angelo; answer his <END>
requiring with a plausible obedience; agree with <END>
his demands to the point; only refer yourself to <END>
this advantage, first, that your stay with him may <END>
not be long; that the time may have all shadow and <END>
silence in it; and the place answer to convenience. <END>
this being granted in course,--and now follows <END>
all,--we shall advise this wronged maid to stead up <END>
your appointment, go in your place; if the encounter <END>
acknowledge itself hereafter, it may compel him to <END>
her recompense: and here, by this, is your brother <END>
saved, your honour untainted, the poor mariana <END>
advantaged, and the corrupt deputy scaled. the maid <END>
will i frame and make fit for his attempt. if you <END>
think well to carry this as you may, the doubleness <END>
of the benefit defends the deceit from reproof. <END>
what think you of it? <END>
the image of it gives me content already; and i <END>
trust it will grow to a most prosperous perfection. <END>
it lies much in your holding up. haste you speedily <END>
to angelo: if for this night he entreat you to his <END>
bed, give him promise of satisfaction. i will <END>
presently to saint luke's: there, at the moated <END>
grange, resides this dejected mariana. at that <END>
place call upon me; and dispatch with angelo, that <END>
it may be quickly. <END>
i thank you for this comfort. fare you well, good father. <END>
nay, if there be no remedy for it, but that you will <END>
needs buy and sell men and women like beasts, we <END>
shall have all the world drink brown and white bastard. <END>
o heavens! what stuff is here <END>
'twas never merry world since, of two usuries, the <END>
merriest was put down, and the worser allowed by <END>
order of law a furred gown to keep him warm; and <END>
furred with fox and lamb-skins too, to signify, that <END>
craft, being richer than innocency, stands for the facing. <END>
come your way, sir. 'bless you, good father friar. <END>
and you, good brother father. what offence hath <END>
this man made you, sir? <END>
marry, sir, he hath offended the law: and, sir, we <END>
take him to be a thief too, sir; for we have found <END>
upon him, sir, a strange picklock, which we have <END>
sent to the deputy. <END>
fie, sirrah! a bawd, a wicked bawd! <END>
the evil that thou causest to be done, <END>
that is thy means to live. do thou but think <END>
what 'tis to cram a maw or clothe a back <END>
from such a filthy vice: say to thyself, <END>
from their abominable and beastly touches <END>
i drink, i eat, array myself, and live. <END>
canst thou believe thy living is a life, <END>
so stinkingly depending? go mend, go mend. <END>
indeed, it does stink in some sort, sir; but yet, <END>
sir, i would prove-- <END>
nay, if the devil have given thee proofs for sin, <END>
thou wilt prove his. take him to prison, officer: <END>
correction and instruction must both work <END>
ere this rude beast will profit. <END>
he must before the deputy, sir; he has given him <END>
warning: the deputy cannot abide a whoremaster: if <END>
he be a whoremonger, and comes before him, he were <END>
as good go a mile on his errand. <END>
that we were all, as some would seem to be, <END>
from our faults, as faults from seeming, free! <END>
his neck will come to your waist,--a cord, sir. <END>
i spy comfort; i cry bail. here's a gentleman and a <END>
friend of mine. <END>
how now, noble pompey! what, at the wheels of <END>
caesar? art thou led in triumph? what, is there <END>
none of pygmalion's images, newly made woman, to be <END>
had now, for putting the hand in the pocket and <END>
extracting it clutch'd? what reply, ha? what <END>
sayest thou to this tune, matter and method? is't <END>
not drowned i' the last rain, ha? what sayest <END>
thou, trot? is the world as it was, man? which is <END>
the way? is it sad, and few words? or how? the <END>
trick of it? <END>
still thus, and thus; still worse! <END>
how doth my dear morsel, thy mistress? procures she <END>
still, ha? <END>
troth, sir, she hath eaten up all her beef, and she <END>
is herself in the tub. <END>
why, 'tis good; it is the right of it; it must be <END>
so: ever your fresh whore and your powdered bawd: <END>
an unshunned consequence; it must be so. art going <END>
to prison, pompey? <END>
yes, faith, sir. <END>
why, 'tis not amiss, pompey. farewell: go, say i <END>
sent thee thither. for debt, pompey? or how? <END>
for being a bawd, for being a bawd. <END>
well, then, imprison him: if imprisonment be the <END>
due of a bawd, why, 'tis his right: bawd is he <END>
doubtless, and of antiquity too; bawd-born. <END>
farewell, good pompey. commend me to the prison, <END>
will keep the house. <END>
i hope, sir, your good worship will be my bail. <END>
no, indeed, will i not, pompey; it is not the wear. <END>
i will pray, pompey, to increase your bondage: if <END>
you take it not patiently, why, your mettle is the <END>
more. adieu, trusty pompey. 'bless you, friar. <END>
and you. <END>
does bridget paint still, pompey, ha? <END>
come your ways, sir; come. <END>
you will not bail me, then, sir? <END>
then, pompey, nor now. what news abroad, friar? <END>
what news? <END>
come your ways, sir; come. <END>
go to kennel, pompey; go. <END>
what news, friar, of the duke? <END>
i know none. can you tell me of any? <END>
some say he is with the emperor of russia; other <END>
some, he is in rome: but where is he, think you? <END>
i know not where; but wheresoever, i wish him well. <END>
it was a mad fantastical trick of him to steal from <END>
the state, and usurp the beggary he was never born <END>
to. lord angelo dukes it well in his absence; he <END>
puts transgression to 't. <END>
he does well in 't. <END>
a little more lenity to lechery would do no harm in <END>
him: something too crabbed that way, friar. <END>
it is too general a vice, and severity must cure it. <END>
yes, in good sooth, the vice is of a great kindred; <END>
it is well allied: but it is impossible to extirp <END>
it quite, friar, till eating and drinking be put <END>
down. they say this angelo was not made by man and <END>
woman after this downright way of creation: is it <END>
true, think you? <END>
how should he be made, then? <END>
some report a sea-maid spawned him; some, that he <END>
was begot between two stock-fishes. but it is <END>
certain that when he makes water his urine is <END>
congealed ice; that i know to be true: and he is a <END>
motion generative; that's infallible. <END>
you are pleasant, sir, and speak apace. <END>
why, what a ruthless thing is this in him, for the <END>
rebellion of a codpiece to take away the life of a <END>
man! would the duke that is absent have done this? <END>
ere he would have hanged a man for the getting a <END>
hundred bastards, he would have paid for the nursing <END>
a thousand: he had some feeling of the sport: he <END>
knew the service, and that instructed him to mercy. <END>
i never heard the absent duke much detected for <END>
women; he was not inclined that way. <END>
o, sir, you are deceived. <END>
'tis not possible. <END>
who, not the duke? yes, your beggar of fifty; and <END>
his use was to put a ducat in her clack-dish: the <END>
duke had crotchets in him. he would be drunk too; <END>
that let me inform you. <END>
you do him wrong, surely. <END>
sir, i was an inward of his. a shy fellow was the <END>
duke: and i believe i know the cause of his <END>
withdrawing. <END>
what, i prithee, might be the cause? <END>
no, pardon; 'tis a secret must be locked within the <END>
teeth and the lips: but this i can let you <END>
understand, the greater file of the subject held the <END>
duke to be wise. <END>
wise! why, no question but he was. <END>
a very superficial, ignorant, unweighing fellow. <END>
either this is the envy in you, folly, or mistaking: <END>
the very stream of his life and the business he hath <END>
helmed must upon a warranted need give him a better <END>
proclamation. let him be but testimonied in his own <END>
bringings-forth, and he shall appear to the <END>
envious a scholar, a statesman and a soldier. <END>
therefore you speak unskilfully: or if your <END>
knowledge be more it is much darkened in your malice. <END>
sir, i know him, and i love him. <END>
love talks with better knowledge, and knowledge with <END>
dearer love. <END>
come, sir, i know what i know. <END>
i can hardly believe that, since you know not what <END>
you speak. but, if ever the duke return, as our <END>
prayers are he may, let me desire you to make your <END>
answer before him. if it be honest you have spoke, <END>
you have courage to maintain it: i am bound to call <END>
upon you; and, i pray you, your name? <END>
sir, my name is lucio; well known to the duke. <END>
he shall know you better, sir, if i may live to <END>
report you. <END>
i fear you not. <END>
o, you hope the duke will return no more; or you <END>
imagine me too unhurtful an opposite. but indeed i <END>
can do you little harm; you'll forswear this again. <END>
i'll be hanged first: thou art deceived in me, <END>
friar. but no more of this. canst thou tell if <END>
claudio die to-morrow or no? <END>
why should he die, sir? <END>
why? for filling a bottle with a tundish. i would <END>
the duke we talk of were returned again: the <END>
ungenitured agent will unpeople the province with <END>
continency; sparrows must not build in his <END>
house-eaves, because they are lecherous. the duke <END>
yet would have dark deeds darkly answered; he would <END>
never bring them to light: would he were returned! <END>
marry, this claudio is condemned for untrussing. <END>
farewell, good friar: i prithee, pray for me. the <END>
duke, i say to thee again, would eat mutton on <END>
fridays. he's not past it yet, and i say to thee, <END>
he would mouth with a beggar, though she smelt brown <END>
bread and garlic: say that i said so. farewell. <END>
no might nor greatness in mortality <END>
can censure 'scape; back-wounding calumny <END>
the whitest virtue strikes. what king so strong <END>
can tie the gall up in the slanderous tongue? <END>
but who comes here? <END>
go; away with her to prison! <END>
good my lord, be good to me; your honour is accounted <END>
a merciful man; good my lord. <END>
double and treble admonition, and still forfeit in <END>
the same kind! this would make mercy swear and play <END>
the tyrant. <END>
a bawd of eleven years' continuance, may it please <END>
your honour. <END>
my lord, this is one lucio's information against me. <END>
mistress kate keepdown was with child by him in the <END>
duke's time; he promised her marriage: his child <END>
is a year and a quarter old, come philip and jacob: <END>
i have kept it myself; and see how he goes about to abuse me! <END>
that fellow is a fellow of much licence: let him be <END>
called before us. away with her to prison! go to; <END>
no more words. <END>
provost, my brother angelo will not be altered; <END>
claudio must die to-morrow: let him be furnished <END>
with divines, and have all charitable preparation. <END>
if my brother wrought by my pity, it should not be <END>
so with him. <END>
so please you, this friar hath been with him, and <END>
advised him for the entertainment of death. <END>
good even, good father. <END>
bliss and goodness on you! <END>
of whence are you? <END>
not of this country, though my chance is now <END>
to use it for my time: i am a brother <END>
of gracious order, late come from the see <END>
in special business from his holiness. <END>
what news abroad i' the world? <END>
none, but that there is so great a fever on <END>
goodness, that the dissolution of it must cure it: <END>
novelty is only in request; and it is as dangerous <END>
to be aged in any kind of course, as it is virtuous <END>
to be constant in any undertaking. there is scarce <END>
truth enough alive to make societies secure; but <END>
security enough to make fellowships accurst: much <END>
upon this riddle runs the wisdom of the world. this <END>
news is old enough, yet it is every day's news. i <END>
pray you, sir, of what disposition was the duke? <END>
one that, above all other strifes, contended <END>
especially to know himself. <END>
what pleasure was he given to? <END>
rather rejoicing to see another merry, than merry at <END>
any thing which professed to make him rejoice: a <END>
gentleman of all temperance. but leave we him to <END>
his events, with a prayer they may prove prosperous; <END>
and let me desire to know how you find claudio <END>
prepared. i am made to understand that you have <END>
lent him visitation. <END>
he professes to have received no sinister measure <END>
from his judge, but most willingly humbles himself <END>
to the determination of justice: yet had he framed <END>
to himself, by the instruction of his frailty, many <END>
deceiving promises of life; which i by my good <END>
leisure have discredited to him, and now is he <END>
resolved to die. <END>
you have paid the heavens your function, and the <END>
prisoner the very debt of your calling. i have <END>
laboured for the poor gentleman to the extremest <END>
shore of my modesty: but my brother justice have i <END>
found so severe, that he hath forced me to tell him <END>
he is indeed justice. <END>
if his own life answer the straitness of his <END>
proceeding, it shall become him well; wherein if he <END>
chance to fail, he hath sentenced himself. <END>
i am going to visit the prisoner. fare you well. <END>
peace be with you! <END>
he who the sword of heaven will bear <END>
should be as holy as severe; <END>
pattern in himself to know, <END>
grace to stand, and virtue go; <END>
more nor less to others paying <END>
than by self-offences weighing. <END>
shame to him whose cruel striking <END>
kills for faults of his own liking! <END>
twice treble shame on angelo, <END>
to weed my vice and let his grow! <END>
o, what may man within him hide, <END>
though angel on the outward side! <END>
how may likeness made in crimes, <END>
making practise on the times, <END>
to draw with idle spiders' strings <END>
most ponderous and substantial things! <END>
craft against vice i must apply: <END>
with angelo to-night shall lie <END>
his old betrothed but despised; <END>
so disguise shall, by the disguised, <END>
pay with falsehood false exacting, <END>
and perform an old contracting. <END>
break off thy song, and haste thee quick away: <END>
here comes a man of comfort, whose advice <END>
hath often still'd my brawling discontent. <END>
i cry you mercy, sir; and well could wish <END>
you had not found me here so musical: <END>
let me excuse me, and believe me so, <END>
my mirth it much displeased, but pleased my woe. <END>
'tis good; though music oft hath such a charm <END>
to make bad good, and good provoke to harm. <END>
i pray, you, tell me, hath any body inquired <END>
for me here to-day? much upon this time have <END>
i promised here to meet. <END>
you have not been inquired after: <END>
i have sat here all day. <END>
i do constantly believe you. the time is come even <END>
now. i shall crave your forbearance a little: may <END>
be i will call upon you anon, for some advantage to yourself. <END>
i am always bound to you. <END>
very well met, and well come. <END>
what is the news from this good deputy? <END>
he hath a garden circummured with brick, <END>
whose western side is with a vineyard back'd; <END>
and to that vineyard is a planched gate, <END>
that makes his opening with this bigger key: <END>
this other doth command a little door <END>
which from the vineyard to the garden leads; <END>
there have i made my promise <END>
upon the heavy middle of the night <END>
to call upon him. <END>
but shall you on your knowledge find this way? <END>
i have ta'en a due and wary note upon't: <END>
with whispering and most guilty diligence, <END>
in action all of precept, he did show me <END>
the way twice o'er. <END>
are there no other tokens <END>
between you 'greed concerning her observance? <END>
no, none, but only a repair i' the dark; <END>
and that i have possess'd him my most stay <END>
can be but brief; for i have made him know <END>
i have a servant comes with me along, <END>
that stays upon me, whose persuasion is <END>
i come about my brother. <END>
'tis well borne up. <END>
i have not yet made known to mariana <END>
a word of this. what, ho! within! come forth! <END>
i pray you, be acquainted with this maid; <END>
she comes to do you good. <END>
i do desire the like. <END>
do you persuade yourself that i respect you? <END>
good friar, i know you do, and have found it. <END>
take, then, this your companion by the hand, <END>
who hath a story ready for your ear. <END>
i shall attend your leisure: but make haste; <END>
the vaporous night approaches. <END>
will't please you walk aside? <END>
o place and greatness! millions of false eyes <END>
are stuck upon thee: volumes of report <END>
run with these false and most contrarious quests <END>
upon thy doings: thousand escapes of wit <END>
make thee the father of their idle dreams <END>
and rack thee in their fancies. <END>
welcome, how agreed? <END>
she'll take the enterprise upon her, father, <END>
if you advise it. <END>
it is not my consent, <END>
but my entreaty too. <END>
little have you to say <END>
when you depart from him, but, soft and low, <END>
'remember now my brother.' <END>
fear me not. <END>
nor, gentle daughter, fear you not at all. <END>
he is your husband on a pre-contract: <END>
to bring you thus together, 'tis no sin, <END>
sith that the justice of your title to him <END>
doth flourish the deceit. come, let us go: <END>
our corn's to reap, for yet our tithe's to sow. <END>
come hither, sirrah. can you cut off a man's head? <END>
if the man be a bachelor, sir, i can; but if he be a <END>
married man, he's his wife's head, and i can never <END>
cut off a woman's head. <END>
come, sir, leave me your snatches, and yield me a <END>
direct answer. to-morrow morning are to die claudio <END>
and barnardine. here is in our prison a common <END>
executioner, who in his office lacks a helper: if <END>
you will take it on you to assist him, it shall <END>
redeem you from your gyves; if not, you shall have <END>
your full time of imprisonment and your deliverance <END>
with an unpitied whipping, for you have been a <END>
notorious bawd. <END>
sir, i have been an unlawful bawd time out of mind; <END>
but yet i will be content to be a lawful hangman. i <END>
would be glad to receive some instruction from my <END>
fellow partner. <END>
what, ho! abhorson! where's abhorson, there? <END>
do you call, sir? <END>
sirrah, here's a fellow will help you to-morrow in <END>
your execution. if you think it meet, compound with <END>
him by the year, and let him abide here with you; if <END>
not, use him for the present and dismiss him. he <END>
cannot plead his estimation with you; he hath been a bawd. <END>
a bawd, sir? fie upon him! he will discredit our mystery. <END>
go to, sir; you weigh equally; a feather will turn <END>
the scale. <END>
pray, sir, by your good favour,--for surely, sir, a <END>
good favour you have, but that you have a hanging <END>
look,--do you call, sir, your occupation a mystery? <END>
ay, sir; a mystery <END>
painting, sir, i have heard say, is a mystery; and <END>
your whores, sir, being members of my occupation, <END>
using painting, do prove my occupation a mystery: <END>
but what mystery there should be in hanging, if i <END>
should be hanged, i cannot imagine. <END>
sir, it is a mystery. <END>
proof? <END>
every true man's apparel fits your thief: if it be <END>
too little for your thief, your true man thinks it <END>
big enough; if it be too big for your thief, your <END>
thief thinks it little enough: so every true man's <END>
apparel fits your thief. <END>
are you agreed? <END>
sir, i will serve him; for i do find your hangman is <END>
a more penitent trade than your bawd; he doth <END>
oftener ask forgiveness. <END>
you, sirrah, provide your block and your axe <END>
to-morrow four o'clock. <END>
come on, bawd; i will instruct thee in my trade; follow. <END>
i do desire to learn, sir: and i hope, if you have <END>
occasion to use me for your own turn, you shall find <END>
me yare; for truly, sir, for your kindness i owe you <END>
a good turn. <END>
call hither barnardine and claudio: <END>
the one has my pity; not a jot the other, <END>
being a murderer, though he were my brother. <END>
look, here's the warrant, claudio, for thy death: <END>
'tis now dead midnight, and by eight to-morrow <END>
thou must be made immortal. where's barnardine? <END>
as fast lock'd up in sleep as guiltless labour <END>
when it lies starkly in the traveller's bones: <END>
he will not wake. <END>
who can do good on him? <END>
well, go, prepare yourself. <END>
but, hark, what noise? <END>
heaven give your spirits comfort! <END>
by and by. <END>
i hope it is some pardon or reprieve <END>
for the most gentle claudio. <END>
welcome father. <END>
the best and wholesomest spirts of the night <END>
envelope you, good provost! who call'd here of late? <END>
none, since the curfew rung. <END>
not isabel? <END>
no. <END>
they will, then, ere't be long. <END>
what comfort is for claudio? <END>
there's some in hope. <END>
it is a bitter deputy. <END>
not so, not so; his life is parallel'd <END>
even with the stroke and line of his great justice: <END>
he doth with holy abstinence subdue <END>
that in himself which he spurs on his power <END>
to qualify in others: were he meal'd with that <END>
which he corrects, then were he tyrannous; <END>
but this being so, he's just. <END>
now are they come. <END>
this is a gentle provost: seldom when <END>
the steeled gaoler is the friend of men. <END>
how now! what noise? that spirit's possessed with haste <END>
that wounds the unsisting postern with these strokes. <END>
there he must stay until the officer <END>
arise to let him in: he is call'd up. <END>
have you no countermand for claudio yet, <END>
but he must die to-morrow? <END>
none, sir, none. <END>
as near the dawning, provost, as it is, <END>
you shall hear more ere morning. <END>
happily <END>
you something know; yet i believe there comes <END>
no countermand; no such example have we: <END>
besides, upon the very siege of justice <END>
lord angelo hath to the public ear <END>
profess'd the contrary. <END>
this is his lordship's man. <END>
and here comes claudio's pardon. <END>
i shall obey him. <END>
i told you. lord angelo, belike thinking me remiss <END>
in mine office, awakens me with this unwonted <END>
putting-on; methinks strangely, for he hath not used it before. <END>
pray you, let's hear. <END>
what is that barnardine who is to be executed in the <END>
afternoon? <END>
a bohemian born, but here nursed un and bred; one <END>
that is a prisoner nine years old. <END>
how came it that the absent duke had not either <END>
delivered him to his liberty or executed him? i <END>
have heard it was ever his manner to do so. <END>
his friends still wrought reprieves for him: and, <END>
indeed, his fact, till now in the government of lord <END>
angelo, came not to an undoubtful proof. <END>
it is now apparent? <END>
most manifest, and not denied by himself. <END>
hath he born himself penitently in prison? how <END>
seems he to be touched? <END>
a man that apprehends death no more dreadfully but <END>
as a drunken sleep; careless, reckless, and fearless <END>
of what's past, present, or to come; insensible of <END>
mortality, and desperately mortal. <END>
he wants advice. <END>
he will hear none: he hath evermore had the liberty <END>
of the prison; give him leave to escape hence, he <END>
would not: drunk many times a day, if not many days <END>
entirely drunk. we have very oft awaked him, as if <END>
to carry him to execution, and showed him a seeming <END>
warrant for it: it hath not moved him at all. <END>
more of him anon. there is written in your brow, <END>
provost, honesty and constancy: if i read it not <END>
truly, my ancient skill beguiles me; but, in the <END>
boldness of my cunning, i will lay myself in hazard. <END>
claudio, whom here you have warrant to execute, is <END>
no greater forfeit to the law than angelo who hath <END>
sentenced him. to make you understand this in a <END>
manifested effect, i crave but four days' respite; <END>
for the which you are to do me both a present and a <END>
dangerous courtesy. <END>
pray, sir, in what? <END>
in the delaying death. <END>
a lack, how may i do it, having the hour limited, <END>
and an express command, under penalty, to deliver <END>
his head in the view of angelo? i may make my case <END>
as claudio's, to cross this in the smallest. <END>
by the vow of mine order i warrant you, if my <END>
instructions may be your guide. let this barnardine <END>
be this morning executed, and his head born to angelo. <END>
angelo hath seen them both, and will discover the favour. <END>
o, death's a great disguiser; and you may add to it. <END>
shave the head, and tie the beard; and say it was <END>
the desire of the penitent to be so bared before his <END>
death: you know the course is common. if any thing <END>
fall to you upon this, more than thanks and good <END>
fortune, by the saint whom i profess, i will plead <END>
against it with my life. <END>
pardon me, good father; it is against my oath. <END>
were you sworn to the duke, or to the deputy? <END>
to him, and to his substitutes. <END>
you will think you have made no offence, if the duke <END>
avouch the justice of your dealing? <END>
but what likelihood is in that? <END>
not a resemblance, but a certainty. yet since i see <END>
you fearful, that neither my coat, integrity, nor <END>
persuasion can with ease attempt you, i will go <END>
further than i meant, to pluck all fears out of you. <END>
look you, sir, here is the hand and seal of the <END>
duke: you know the character, i doubt not; and the <END>
signet is not strange to you. <END>
i know them both. <END>
the contents of this is the return of the duke: you <END>
shall anon over-read it at your pleasure; where you <END>
shall find, within these two days he will be here. <END>
this is a thing that angelo knows not; for he this <END>
very day receives letters of strange tenor; <END>
perchance of the duke's death; perchance entering <END>
into some monastery; but, by chance, nothing of what <END>
is writ. look, the unfolding star calls up the <END>
shepherd. put not yourself into amazement how these <END>
things should be: all difficulties are but easy <END>
when they are known. call your executioner, and off <END>
with barnardine's head: i will give him a present <END>
shrift and advise him for a better place. yet you <END>
are amazed; but this shall absolutely resolve you. <END>
come away; it is almost clear dawn. <END>
i am as well acquainted here as i was in our house <END>
of profession: one would think it were mistress <END>
overdone's own house, for here be many of her old <END>
customers. first, here's young master rash; he's in <END>
for a commodity of brown paper and old ginger, <END>
ninescore and seventeen pounds; of which he made <END>
five marks, ready money: marry, then ginger was not <END>
much in request, for the old women were all dead. <END>
then is there here one master caper, at the suit of <END>
master three-pile the mercer, for some four suits of <END>
peach-coloured satin, which now peaches him a <END>
beggar. then have we here young dizy, and young <END>
master deep-vow, and master copperspur, and master <END>
starve-lackey the rapier and dagger man, and young <END>
drop-heir that killed lusty pudding, and master <END>
forthlight the tilter, and brave master shooty the <END>
great traveller, and wild half-can that stabbed <END>
pots, and, i think, forty more; all great doers in <END>
our trade, and are now 'for the lord's sake.' <END>
sirrah, bring barnardine hither. <END>
master barnardine! you must rise and be hanged. <END>
master barnardine! <END>
what, ho, barnardine! <END>
your friends, sir; the hangman. you must be so <END>
good, sir, to rise and be put to death. <END>
tell him he must awake, and that quickly too. <END>
pray, master barnardine, awake till you are <END>
executed, and sleep afterwards. <END>
go in to him, and fetch him out. <END>
he is coming, sir, he is coming; i hear his straw rustle. <END>
is the axe upon the block, sirrah? <END>
very ready, sir. <END>
how now, abhorson? what's the news with you? <END>
truly, sir, i would desire you to clap into your <END>
prayers; for, look you, the warrant's come. <END>
you rogue, i have been drinking all night; i am not <END>
fitted for 't. <END>
o, the better, sir; for he that drinks all night, <END>
and is hanged betimes in the morning, may sleep the <END>
sounder all the next day. <END>
look you, sir; here comes your ghostly father: do <END>
we jest now, think you? <END>
sir, induced by my charity, and hearing how hastily <END>
you are to depart, i am come to advise you, comfort <END>
you and pray with you. <END>
friar, not i i have been drinking hard all night, <END>
and i will have more time to prepare me, or they <END>
shall beat out my brains with billets: i will not <END>
consent to die this day, that's certain. <END>
o, sir, you must: and therefore i beseech you <END>
look forward on the journey you shall go. <END>
i swear i will not die to-day for any man's <END>
persuasion. <END>
but hear you. <END>
not a word: if you have any thing to say to me, <END>
come to my ward; for thence will not i to-day. <END>
unfit to live or die: o gravel heart! <END>
after him, fellows; bring him to the block. <END>
now, sir, how do you find the prisoner? <END>
a creature unprepared, unmeet for death; <END>
and to transport him in the mind he is <END>
were damnable. <END>
here in the prison, father, <END>
there died this morning of a cruel fever <END>
one ragozine, a most notorious pirate, <END>
a man of claudio's years; his beard and head <END>
just of his colour. what if we do omit <END>
this reprobate till he were well inclined; <END>
and satisfy the deputy with the visage <END>
of ragozine, more like to claudio? <END>
o, 'tis an accident that heaven provides! <END>
dispatch it presently; the hour draws on <END>
prefix'd by angelo: see this be done, <END>
and sent according to command; whiles i <END>
persuade this rude wretch willingly to die. <END>
this shall be done, good father, presently. <END>
but barnardine must die this afternoon: <END>
and how shall we continue claudio, <END>
to save me from the danger that might come <END>
if he were known alive? <END>
let this be done. <END>
put them in secret holds, both barnardine and claudio: <END>
ere twice the sun hath made his journal greeting <END>
to the under generation, you shall find <END>
your safety manifested. <END>
i am your free dependant. <END>
quick, dispatch, and send the head to angelo. <END>
now will i write letters to angelo,-- <END>
the provost, he shall bear them, whose contents <END>
shall witness to him i am near at home, <END>
and that, by great injunctions, i am bound <END>
to enter publicly: him i'll desire <END>
to meet me at the consecrated fount <END>
a league below the city; and from thence, <END>
by cold gradation and well-balanced form, <END>
we shall proceed with angelo. <END>
here is the head; i'll carry it myself. <END>
convenient is it. make a swift return; <END>
for i would commune with you of such things <END>
that want no ear but yours. <END>
i'll make all speed. <END>
the tongue of isabel. she's come to know <END>
if yet her brother's pardon be come hither: <END>
but i will keep her ignorant of her good, <END>
to make her heavenly comforts of despair, <END>
when it is least expected. <END>
ho, by your leave! <END>
good morning to you, fair and gracious daughter. <END>
the better, given me by so holy a man. <END>
hath yet the deputy sent my brother's pardon? <END>
he hath released him, isabel, from the world: <END>
his head is off and sent to angelo. <END>
nay, but it is not so. <END>
it is no other: show your wisdom, daughter, <END>
in your close patience. <END>
o, i will to him and pluck out his eyes! <END>
you shall not be admitted to his sight. <END>
unhappy claudio! wretched isabel! <END>
injurious world! most damned angelo! <END>
this nor hurts him nor profits you a jot; <END>
forbear it therefore; give your cause to heaven. <END>
mark what i say, which you shall find <END>
by every syllable a faithful verity: <END>
the duke comes home to-morrow; nay, dry your eyes; <END>
one of our convent, and his confessor, <END>
gives me this instance: already he hath carried <END>
notice to escalus and angelo, <END>
who do prepare to meet him at the gates, <END>
there to give up their power. if you can, pace your wisdom <END>
in that good path that i would wish it go, <END>
and you shall have your bosom on this wretch, <END>
grace of the duke, revenges to your heart, <END>
and general honour. <END>
i am directed by you. <END>
this letter, then, to friar peter give; <END>
'tis that he sent me of the duke's return: <END>
say, by this token, i desire his company <END>
at mariana's house to-night. her cause and yours <END>
i'll perfect him withal, and he shall bring you <END>
before the duke, and to the head of angelo <END>
accuse him home and home. for my poor self, <END>
i am combined by a sacred vow <END>
and shall be absent. wend you with this letter: <END>
command these fretting waters from your eyes <END>
with a light heart; trust not my holy order, <END>
if i pervert your course. who's here? <END>
good even. friar, where's the provost? <END>
not within, sir. <END>
o pretty isabella, i am pale at mine heart to see <END>
thine eyes so red: thou must be patient. i am fain <END>
to dine and sup with water and bran; i dare not for <END>
my head fill my belly; one fruitful meal would set <END>
me to 't. but they say the duke will be here <END>
to-morrow. by my troth, isabel, i loved thy brother: <END>
if the old fantastical duke of dark corners had been <END>
at home, he had lived. <END>
sir, the duke is marvellous little beholding to your <END>
reports; but the best is, he lives not in them. <END>
friar, thou knowest not the duke so well as i do: <END>
he's a better woodman than thou takest him for. <END>
well, you'll answer this one day. fare ye well. <END>
nay, tarry; i'll go along with thee <END>
i can tell thee pretty tales of the duke. <END>
you have told me too many of him already, sir, if <END>
they be true; if not true, none were enough. <END>
i was once before him for getting a wench with child. <END>
did you such a thing? <END>
yes, marry, did i but i was fain to forswear it; <END>
they would else have married me to the rotten medlar. <END>
sir, your company is fairer than honest. rest you well. <END>
by my troth, i'll go with thee to the lane's end: <END>
if bawdy talk offend you, we'll have very little of <END>
it. nay, friar, i am a kind of burr; i shall stick. <END>
every letter he hath writ hath disvouched other. <END>
in most uneven and distracted manner. his actions <END>
show much like to madness: pray heaven his wisdom be <END>
not tainted! and why meet him at the gates, and <END>
redeliver our authorities there <END>
i guess not. <END>
and why should we proclaim it in an hour before his <END>
entering, that if any crave redress of injustice, <END>
they should exhibit their petitions in the street? <END>
he shows his reason for that: to have a dispatch of <END>
complaints, and to deliver us from devices <END>
hereafter, which shall then have no power to stand <END>
against us. <END>
well, i beseech you, let it be proclaimed betimes <END>
i' the morn; i'll call you at your house: give <END>
notice to such men of sort and suit as are to meet <END>
him. <END>
i shall, sir. fare you well. <END>
good night. <END>
this deed unshapes me quite, makes me unpregnant <END>
and dull to all proceedings. a deflower'd maid! <END>
and by an eminent body that enforced <END>
the law against it! but that her tender shame <END>
will not proclaim against her maiden loss, <END>
how might she tongue me! yet reason dares her no; <END>
for my authority bears of a credent bulk, <END>
that no particular scandal once can touch <END>
but it confounds the breather. he should have lived, <END>
save that riotous youth, with dangerous sense, <END>
might in the times to come have ta'en revenge, <END>
by so receiving a dishonour'd life <END>
with ransom of such shame. would yet he had lived! <END>
a lack, when once our grace we have forgot, <END>
nothing goes right: we would, and we would not. <END>
these letters at fit time deliver me <END>
the provost knows our purpose and our plot. <END>
the matter being afoot, keep your instruction, <END>
and hold you ever to our special drift; <END>
though sometimes you do blench from this to that, <END>
as cause doth minister. go call at flavius' house, <END>
and tell him where i stay: give the like notice <END>
to valentinus, rowland, and to crassus, <END>
and bid them bring the trumpets to the gate; <END>
but send me flavius first. <END>
it shall be speeded well. <END>
i thank thee, varrius; thou hast made good haste: <END>
come, we will walk. there's other of our friends <END>
will greet us here anon, my gentle varrius. <END>
to speak so indirectly i am loath: <END>
i would say the truth; but to accuse him so, <END>
that is your part: yet i am advised to do it; <END>
he says, to veil full purpose. <END>
be ruled by him. <END>
besides, he tells me that, if peradventure <END>
he speak against me on the adverse side, <END>
i should not think it strange; for 'tis a physic <END>
that's bitter to sweet end. <END>
i would friar peter-- <END>
o, peace! the friar is come. <END>
come, i have found you out a stand most fit, <END>
where you may have such vantage on the duke, <END>
he shall not pass you. twice have the trumpets sounded; <END>
the generous and gravest citizens <END>
have hent the gates, and very near upon <END>
the duke is entering: therefore, hence, away! <END>
my very worthy cousin, fairly met! <END>
our old and faithful friend, we are glad to see you. <END>
happy return be to your royal grace! <END>
many and hearty thankings to you both. <END>
we have made inquiry of you; and we hear <END>
such goodness of your justice, that our soul <END>
cannot but yield you forth to public thanks, <END>
forerunning more requital. <END>
you make my bonds still greater. <END>
o, your desert speaks loud; and i should wrong it, <END>
to lock it in the wards of covert bosom, <END>
when it deserves, with characters of brass, <END>
a forted residence 'gainst the tooth of time <END>
and razure of oblivion. give me your hand, <END>
and let the subject see, to make them know <END>
that outward courtesies would fain proclaim <END>
favours that keep within. come, escalus, <END>
you must walk by us on our other hand; <END>
and good supporters are you. <END>
now is your time: speak loud and kneel before him. <END>
justice, o royal duke! vail your regard <END>
upon a wrong'd, i would fain have said, a maid! <END>
o worthy prince, dishonour not your eye <END>
by throwing it on any other object <END>
till you have heard me in my true complaint <END>
and given me justice, justice, justice, justice! <END>
relate your wrongs; in what? by whom? be brief. <END>
here is lord angelo shall give you justice: <END>
reveal yourself to him. <END>
o worthy duke, <END>
you bid me seek redemption of the devil: <END>
hear me yourself; for that which i must speak <END>
must either punish me, not being believed, <END>
or wring redress from you. hear me, o hear me, here! <END>
my lord, her wits, i fear me, are not firm: <END>
she hath been a suitor to me for her brother <END>
cut off by course of justice,-- <END>
by course of justice! <END>
and she will speak most bitterly and strange. <END>
most strange, but yet most truly, will i speak: <END>
that angelo's forsworn; is it not strange? <END>
that angelo's a murderer; is 't not strange? <END>
that angelo is an adulterous thief, <END>
an hypocrite, a virgin-violator; <END>
is it not strange and strange? <END>
nay, it is ten times strange. <END>
it is not truer he is angelo <END>
than this is all as true as it is strange: <END>
nay, it is ten times true; for truth is truth <END>
to the end of reckoning. <END>
away with her! poor soul, <END>
she speaks this in the infirmity of sense. <END>
o prince, i conjure thee, as thou believest <END>
there is another comfort than this world, <END>
that thou neglect me not, with that opinion <END>
that i am touch'd with madness! make not impossible <END>
that which but seems unlike: 'tis not impossible <END>
but one, the wicked'st caitiff on the ground, <END>
may seem as shy, as grave, as just, as absolute <END>
as angelo; even so may angelo, <END>
in all his dressings, characts, titles, forms, <END>
be an arch-villain; believe it, royal prince: <END>
if he be less, he's nothing; but he's more, <END>
had i more name for badness. <END>
by mine honesty, <END>
if she be mad,--as i believe no other,-- <END>
her madness hath the oddest frame of sense, <END>
such a dependency of thing on thing, <END>
as e'er i heard in madness. <END>
o gracious duke, <END>
harp not on that, nor do not banish reason <END>
for inequality; but let your reason serve <END>
to make the truth appear where it seems hid, <END>
and hide the false seems true. <END>
many that are not mad <END>
have, sure, more lack of reason. what would you say? <END>
i am the sister of one claudio, <END>
condemn'd upon the act of fornication <END>
to lose his head; condemn'd by angelo: <END>
i, in probation of a sisterhood, <END>
was sent to by my brother; one lucio <END>
as then the messenger,-- <END>
that's i, an't like your grace: <END>
i came to her from claudio, and desired her <END>
to try her gracious fortune with lord angelo <END>
for her poor brother's pardon. <END>
that's he indeed. <END>
you were not bid to speak. <END>
no, my good lord; <END>
nor wish'd to hold my peace. <END>
i wish you now, then; <END>
pray you, take note of it: and when you have <END>
a business for yourself, pray heaven you then <END>
be perfect. <END>
i warrant your honour. <END>
the warrants for yourself; take heed to't. <END>
this gentleman told somewhat of my tale,-- <END>
right. <END>
it may be right; but you are i' the wrong <END>
to speak before your time. proceed. <END>
i went <END>
to this pernicious caitiff deputy,-- <END>
that's somewhat madly spoken. <END>
pardon it; <END>
the phrase is to the matter. <END>
mended again. the matter; proceed. <END>
in brief, to set the needless process by, <END>
how i persuaded, how i pray'd, and kneel'd, <END>
how he refell'd me, and how i replied,-- <END>
for this was of much length,--the vile conclusion <END>
i now begin with grief and shame to utter: <END>
he would not, but by gift of my chaste body <END>
to his concupiscible intemperate lust, <END>
release my brother; and, after much debatement, <END>
my sisterly remorse confutes mine honour, <END>
and i did yield to him: but the next morn betimes, <END>
his purpose surfeiting, he sends a warrant <END>
for my poor brother's head. <END>
this is most likely! <END>
o, that it were as like as it is true! <END>
by heaven, fond wretch, thou knowist not what thou speak'st, <END>
or else thou art suborn'd against his honour <END>
in hateful practise. first, his integrity <END>
stands without blemish. next, it imports no reason <END>
that with such vehemency he should pursue <END>
faults proper to himself: if he had so offended, <END>
he would have weigh'd thy brother by himself <END>
and not have cut him off. some one hath set you on: <END>
confess the truth, and say by whose advice <END>
thou camest here to complain. <END>
and is this all? <END>
then, o you blessed ministers above, <END>
keep me in patience, and with ripen'd time <END>
unfold the evil which is here wrapt up <END>
in countenance! heaven shield your grace from woe, <END>
as i, thus wrong'd, hence unbelieved go! <END>
i know you'ld fain be gone. an officer! <END>
to prison with her! shall we thus permit <END>
a blasting and a scandalous breath to fall <END>
on him so near us? this needs must be a practise. <END>
who knew of your intent and coming hither? <END>
one that i would were here, friar lodowick. <END>
a ghostly father, belike. who knows that lodowick? <END>
my lord, i know him; 'tis a meddling friar; <END>
i do not like the man: had he been lay, my lord <END>
for certain words he spake against your grace <END>
in your retirement, i had swinged him soundly. <END>
words against me? this is a good friar, belike! <END>
and to set on this wretched woman here <END>
against our substitute! let this friar be found. <END>
but yesternight, my lord, she and that friar, <END>
i saw them at the prison: a saucy friar, <END>
a very scurvy fellow. <END>
blessed be your royal grace! <END>
i have stood by, my lord, and i have heard <END>
your royal ear abused. first, hath this woman <END>
most wrongfully accused your substitute, <END>
who is as free from touch or soil with her <END>
as she from one ungot. <END>
we did believe no less. <END>
know you that friar lodowick that she speaks of? <END>
i know him for a man divine and holy; <END>
not scurvy, nor a temporary meddler, <END>
as he's reported by this gentleman; <END>
and, on my trust, a man that never yet <END>
did, as he vouches, misreport your grace. <END>
my lord, most villanously; believe it. <END>
well, he in time may come to clear himself; <END>
but at this instant he is sick my lord, <END>
of a strange fever. upon his mere request, <END>
being come to knowledge that there was complaint <END>
intended 'gainst lord angelo, came i hither, <END>
to speak, as from his mouth, what he doth know <END>
is true and false; and what he with his oath <END>
and all probation will make up full clear, <END>
whensoever he's convented. first, for this woman. <END>
to justify this worthy nobleman, <END>
so vulgarly and personally accused, <END>
her shall you hear disproved to her eyes, <END>
till she herself confess it. <END>
good friar, let's hear it. <END>
do you not smile at this, lord angelo? <END>
o heaven, the vanity of wretched fools! <END>
give us some seats. come, cousin angelo; <END>
in this i'll be impartial; be you judge <END>
of your own cause. is this the witness, friar? <END>
first, let her show her face, and after speak. <END>
pardon, my lord; i will not show my face <END>
until my husband bid me. <END>
what, are you married? <END>
no, my lord. <END>
are you a maid? <END>
no, my lord. <END>
a widow, then? <END>
neither, my lord. <END>
why, you are nothing then: neither maid, widow, nor wife? <END>
my lord, she may be a punk; for many of them are <END>
neither maid, widow, nor wife. <END>
silence that fellow: i would he had some cause <END>
to prattle for himself. <END>
well, my lord. <END>
my lord; i do confess i ne'er was married; <END>
and i confess besides i am no maid: <END>
i have known my husband; yet my husband <END>
knows not that ever he knew me. <END>
he was drunk then, my lord: it can be no better. <END>
for the benefit of silence, would thou wert so too! <END>
well, my lord. <END>
this is no witness for lord angelo. <END>
now i come to't my lord <END>
she that accuses him of fornication, <END>
in self-same manner doth accuse my husband, <END>
and charges him my lord, with such a time <END>
when i'll depose i had him in mine arms <END>
with all the effect of love. <END>
charges she more than me? <END>
not that i know. <END>
no? you say your husband. <END>
why, just, my lord, and that is angelo, <END>
who thinks he knows that he ne'er knew my body, <END>
but knows he thinks that he knows isabel's. <END>
this is a strange abuse. let's see thy face. <END>
my husband bids me; now i will unmask. <END>
this is that face, thou cruel angelo, <END>
which once thou sworest was worth the looking on; <END>
this is the hand which, with a vow'd contract, <END>
was fast belock'd in thine; this is the body <END>
that took away the match from isabel, <END>
and did supply thee at thy garden-house <END>
in her imagined person. <END>
know you this woman? <END>
carnally, she says. <END>
sirrah, no more! <END>
enough, my lord. <END>
my lord, i must confess i know this woman: <END>
and five years since there was some speech of marriage <END>
betwixt myself and her; which was broke off, <END>
partly for that her promised proportions <END>
came short of composition, but in chief <END>
for that her reputation was disvalued <END>
in levity: since which time of five years <END>
i never spake with her, saw her, nor heard from her, <END>
upon my faith and honour. <END>
noble prince, <END>
as there comes light from heaven and words from breath, <END>
as there is sense in truth and truth in virtue, <END>
i am affianced this man's wife as strongly <END>
as words could make up vows: and, my good lord, <END>
but tuesday night last gone in's garden-house <END>
he knew me as a wife. as this is true, <END>
let me in safety raise me from my knees <END>
or else for ever be confixed here, <END>
a marble monument! <END>
i did but smile till now: <END>
now, good my lord, give me the scope of justice <END>
my patience here is touch'd. i do perceive <END>
these poor informal women are no more <END>
but instruments of some more mightier member <END>
that sets them on: let me have way, my lord, <END>
to find this practise out. <END>
ay, with my heart <END>
and punish them to your height of pleasure. <END>
thou foolish friar, and thou pernicious woman, <END>
compact with her that's gone, think'st thou thy oaths, <END>
though they would swear down each particular saint, <END>
were testimonies against his worth and credit <END>
that's seal'd in approbation? you, lord escalus, <END>
sit with my cousin; lend him your kind pains <END>
to find out this abuse, whence 'tis derived. <END>
there is another friar that set them on; <END>
let him be sent for. <END>
would he were here, my lord! for he indeed <END>
hath set the women on to this complaint: <END>
your provost knows the place where he abides <END>
and he may fetch him. <END>
go do it instantly. <END>
and you, my noble and well-warranted cousin, <END>
whom it concerns to hear this matter forth, <END>
do with your injuries as seems you best, <END>
in any chastisement: i for a while will leave you; <END>
but stir not you till you have well determined <END>
upon these slanderers. <END>
my lord, we'll do it throughly. <END>
signior lucio, did not you say you knew that <END>
friar lodowick to be a dishonest person? <END>
'cucullus non facit monachum:' honest in nothing <END>
but in his clothes; and one that hath spoke most <END>
villanous speeches of the duke. <END>
we shall entreat you to abide here till he come and <END>
enforce them against him: we shall find this friar a <END>
notable fellow. <END>
as any in vienna, on my word. <END>
call that same isabel here once again; i would speak with her. <END>
pray you, my lord, give me leave to question; you <END>
shall see how i'll handle her. <END>
not better than he, by her own report. <END>
say you? <END>
marry, sir, i think, if you handled her privately, <END>
she would sooner confess: perchance, publicly, <END>
she'll be ashamed. <END>
i will go darkly to work with her. <END>
that's the way; for women are light at midnight. <END>
come on, mistress: here's a gentlewoman denies all <END>
that you have said. <END>
my lord, here comes the rascal i spoke of; here with <END>
the provost. <END>
in very good time: speak not you to him till we <END>
call upon you. <END>
mum. <END>
come, sir: did you set these women on to slander <END>
lord angelo? they have confessed you did. <END>
'tis false. <END>
how! know you where you are? <END>
respect to your great place! and let the devil <END>
be sometime honour'd for his burning throne! <END>
where is the duke? 'tis he should hear me speak. <END>
the duke's in us; and we will hear you speak: <END>
look you speak justly. <END>
boldly, at least. but, o, poor souls, <END>
come you to seek the lamb here of the fox? <END>
good night to your redress! is the duke gone? <END>
then is your cause gone too. the duke's unjust, <END>
thus to retort your manifest appeal, <END>
and put your trial in the villain's mouth <END>
which here you come to accuse. <END>
this is the rascal; this is he i spoke of. <END>
why, thou unreverend and unhallow'd friar, <END>
is't not enough thou hast suborn'd these women <END>
to accuse this worthy man, but, in foul mouth <END>
and in the witness of his proper ear, <END>
to call him villain? and then to glance from him <END>
to the duke himself, to tax him with injustice? <END>
take him hence; to the rack with him! we'll touse you <END>
joint by joint, but we will know his purpose. <END>
what 'unjust'! <END>
be not so hot; the duke <END>
dare no more stretch this finger of mine than he <END>
dare rack his own: his subject am i not, <END>
nor here provincial. my business in this state <END>
made me a looker on here in vienna, <END>
where i have seen corruption boil and bubble <END>
till it o'er-run the stew; laws for all faults, <END>
but faults so countenanced, that the strong statutes <END>
stand like the forfeits in a barber's shop, <END>
as much in mock as mark. <END>
slander to the state! away with him to prison! <END>
what can you vouch against him, signior lucio? <END>
is this the man that you did tell us of? <END>
'tis he, my lord. come hither, goodman baldpate: <END>
do you know me? <END>
i remember you, sir, by the sound of your voice: i <END>
met you at the prison, in the absence of the duke. <END>
o, did you so? and do you remember what you said of the duke? <END>
most notedly, sir. <END>
do you so, sir? and was the duke a fleshmonger, a <END>
fool, and a coward, as you then reported him to be? <END>
you must, sir, change persons with me, ere you make <END>
that my report: you, indeed, spoke so of him; and <END>
much more, much worse. <END>
o thou damnable fellow! did not i pluck thee by the <END>
nose for thy speeches? <END>
i protest i love the duke as i love myself. <END>
hark, how the villain would close now, after his <END>
treasonable abuses! <END>
such a fellow is not to be talked withal. away with <END>
him to prison! where is the provost? away with him <END>
to prison! lay bolts enough upon him: let him <END>
speak no more. away with those giglots too, and <END>
with the other confederate companion! <END>
what, resists he? help him, lucio. <END>
come, sir; come, sir; come, sir; foh, sir! why, you <END>
bald-pated, lying rascal, you must be hooded, must <END>
you? show your knave's visage, with a pox to you! <END>
show your sheep-biting face, and be hanged an hour! <END>
will't not off? <END>
thou art the first knave that e'er madest a duke. <END>
first, provost, let me bail these gentle three. <END>
sneak not away, sir; for the friar and you <END>
must have a word anon. lay hold on him. <END>
this may prove worse than hanging. <END>
o my dread lord, <END>
i should be guiltier than my guiltiness, <END>
to think i can be undiscernible, <END>
when i perceive your grace, like power divine, <END>
hath look'd upon my passes. then, good prince, <END>
no longer session hold upon my shame, <END>
but let my trial be mine own confession: <END>
immediate sentence then and sequent death <END>
is all the grace i beg. <END>
come hither, mariana. <END>
say, wast thou e'er contracted to this woman? <END>
i was, my lord. <END>
go take her hence, and marry her instantly. <END>
do you the office, friar; which consummate, <END>
return him here again. go with him, provost. <END>
my lord, i am more amazed at his dishonour <END>
than at the strangeness of it. <END>
come hither, isabel. <END>
your friar is now your prince: as i was then <END>
advertising and holy to your business, <END>
not changing heart with habit, i am still <END>
attorney'd at your service. <END>
o, give me pardon, <END>
that i, your vassal, have employ'd and pain'd <END>
your unknown sovereignty! <END>
you are pardon'd, isabel: <END>
and now, dear maid, be you as free to us. <END>
your brother's death, i know, sits at your heart; <END>
and you may marvel why i obscured myself, <END>
labouring to save his life, and would not rather <END>
make rash remonstrance of my hidden power <END>
than let him so be lost. o most kind maid, <END>
it was the swift celerity of his death, <END>
which i did think with slower foot came on, <END>
that brain'd my purpose. but, peace be with him! <END>
that life is better life, past fearing death, <END>
than that which lives to fear: make it your comfort, <END>
so happy is your brother. <END>
i do, my lord. <END>
for this new-married man approaching here, <END>
whose salt imagination yet hath wrong'd <END>
your well defended honour, you must pardon <END>
for mariana's sake: but as he adjudged your brother,-- <END>
being criminal, in double violation <END>
of sacred chastity and of promise-breach <END>
thereon dependent, for your brother's life,-- <END>
the very mercy of the law cries out <END>
most audible, even from his proper tongue, <END>
'an angelo for claudio, death for death!' <END>
haste still pays haste, and leisure answers leisure; <END>
like doth quit like, and measure still for measure. <END>
then, angelo, thy fault's thus manifested; <END>
which, though thou wouldst deny, denies thee vantage. <END>
we do condemn thee to the very block <END>
where claudio stoop'd to death, and with like haste. <END>
away with him! <END>
o my most gracious lord, <END>
i hope you will not mock me with a husband. <END>
it is your husband mock'd you with a husband. <END>
consenting to the safeguard of your honour, <END>
i thought your marriage fit; else imputation, <END>
for that he knew you, might reproach your life <END>
and choke your good to come; for his possessions, <END>
although by confiscation they are ours, <END>
we do instate and widow you withal, <END>
to buy you a better husband. <END>
o my dear lord, <END>
i crave no other, nor no better man. <END>
never crave him; we are definitive. <END>
gentle my liege,-- <END>
you do but lose your labour. <END>
away with him to death! <END>
now, sir, to you. <END>
o my good lord! sweet isabel, take my part; <END>
lend me your knees, and all my life to come <END>
i'll lend you all my life to do you service. <END>
against all sense you do importune her: <END>
should she kneel down in mercy of this fact, <END>
her brother's ghost his paved bed would break, <END>
and take her hence in horror. <END>
isabel, <END>
sweet isabel, do yet but kneel by me; <END>
hold up your hands, say nothing; i'll speak all. <END>
they say, best men are moulded out of faults; <END>
and, for the most, become much more the better <END>
for being a little bad: so may my husband. <END>
o isabel, will you not lend a knee? <END>
he dies for claudio's death. <END>
most bounteous sir, <END>
look, if it please you, on this man condemn'd, <END>
as if my brother lived: i partly think <END>
a due sincerity govern'd his deeds, <END>
till he did look on me: since it is so, <END>
let him not die. my brother had but justice, <END>
in that he did the thing for which he died: <END>
for angelo, <END>
his act did not o'ertake his bad intent, <END>
and must be buried but as an intent <END>
that perish'd by the way: thoughts are no subjects; <END>
intents but merely thoughts. <END>
merely, my lord. <END>
your suit's unprofitable; stand up, i say. <END>
i have bethought me of another fault. <END>
provost, how came it claudio was beheaded <END>
at an unusual hour? <END>
it was commanded so. <END>
had you a special warrant for the deed? <END>
no, my good lord; it was by private message. <END>
for which i do discharge you of your office: <END>
give up your keys. <END>
pardon me, noble lord: <END>
i thought it was a fault, but knew it not; <END>
yet did repent me, after more advice; <END>
for testimony whereof, one in the prison, <END>
that should by private order else have died, <END>
i have reserved alive. <END>
what's he? <END>
his name is barnardine. <END>
i would thou hadst done so by claudio. <END>
go fetch him hither; let me look upon him. <END>
i am sorry, one so learned and so wise <END>
as you, lord angelo, have still appear'd, <END>
should slip so grossly, both in the heat of blood. <END>
and lack of temper'd judgment afterward. <END>
i am sorry that such sorrow i procure: <END>
and so deep sticks it in my penitent heart <END>
that i crave death more willingly than mercy; <END>
'tis my deserving, and i do entreat it. <END>
which is that barnardine? <END>
this, my lord. <END>
there was a friar told me of this man. <END>
sirrah, thou art said to have a stubborn soul. <END>
that apprehends no further than this world, <END>
and squarest thy life according. thou'rt condemn'd: <END>
but, for those earthly faults, i quit them all; <END>
and pray thee take this mercy to provide <END>
for better times to come. friar, advise him; <END>
i leave him to your hand. what muffled fellow's that? <END>
this is another prisoner that i saved. <END>
who should have died when claudio lost his head; <END>
as like almost to claudio as himself. <END>
'faith, my lord. i spoke it but according to the <END>
trick. if you will hang me for it, you may; but i <END>
had rather it would please you i might be whipt. <END>
whipt first, sir, and hanged after. <END>
proclaim it, provost, round about the city. <END>
is any woman wrong'd by this lewd fellow, <END>
as i have heard him swear himself there's one <END>
whom he begot with child, let her appear, <END>
and he shall marry her: the nuptial finish'd, <END>
let him be whipt and hang'd. <END>
i beseech your highness, do not marry me to a whore. <END>
your highness said even now, i made you a duke: <END>
good my lord, do not recompense me in making me a cuckold. <END>
upon mine honour, thou shalt marry her. <END>
thy slanders i forgive; and therewithal <END>
remit thy other forfeits. take him to prison; <END>
and see our pleasure herein executed. <END>
marrying a punk, my lord, is pressing to death, <END>
whipping, and hanging. <END>
slandering a prince deserves it. <END>
she, claudio, that you wrong'd, look you restore. <END>
joy to you, mariana! love her, angelo: <END>
i have confess'd her and i know her virtue. <END>
thanks, good friend escalus, for thy much goodness: <END>
there's more behind that is more gratulate. <END>
thanks, provost, for thy care and secrecy: <END>
we shill employ thee in a worthier place. <END>
forgive him, angelo, that brought you home <END>
the head of ragozine for claudio's: <END>
the offence pardons itself. dear isabel, <END>
i have a motion much imports your good; <END>
whereto if you'll a willing ear incline, <END>
what's mine is yours and what is yours is mine. <END>
so, bring us to our palace; where we'll show <END>
what's yet behind, that's meet you all should know. <END>
i'll pheeze you, in faith. <END>
a pair of stocks, you rogue! <END>
ye are a baggage: the slys are no rogues; look in <END>
the chronicles; we came in with richard conqueror. <END>
therefore paucas pallabris; let the world slide: sessa! <END>
you will not pay for the glasses you have burst? <END>
no, not a denier. go by, jeronimy: go to thy cold <END>
bed, and warm thee. <END>
i know my remedy; i must go fetch the <END>
third--borough. <END>
third, or fourth, or fifth borough, i'll answer him <END>
by law: i'll not budge an inch, boy: let him come, <END>
and kindly. <END>
huntsman, i charge thee, tender well my hounds: <END>
brach merriman, the poor cur is emboss'd; <END>
and couple clowder with the deep--mouth'd brach. <END>
saw'st thou not, boy, how silver made it good <END>
at the hedge-corner, in the coldest fault? <END>
i would not lose the dog for twenty pound. <END>
why, belman is as good as he, my lord; <END>
he cried upon it at the merest loss <END>
and twice to-day pick'd out the dullest scent: <END>
trust me, i take him for the better dog. <END>
thou art a fool: if echo were as fleet, <END>
i would esteem him worth a dozen such. <END>
but sup them well and look unto them all: <END>
to-morrow i intend to hunt again. <END>
i will, my lord. <END>
what's here? one dead, or drunk? see, doth he breathe? <END>
he breathes, my lord. were he not warm'd with ale, <END>
this were a bed but cold to sleep so soundly. <END>
o monstrous beast! how like a swine he lies! <END>
grim death, how foul and loathsome is thine image! <END>
sirs, i will practise on this drunken man. <END>
what think you, if he were convey'd to bed, <END>
wrapp'd in sweet clothes, rings put upon his fingers, <END>
a most delicious banquet by his bed, <END>
and brave attendants near him when he wakes, <END>
would not the beggar then forget himself? <END>
believe me, lord, i think he cannot choose. <END>
it would seem strange unto him when he waked. <END>
even as a flattering dream or worthless fancy. <END>
then take him up and manage well the jest: <END>
carry him gently to my fairest chamber <END>
and hang it round with all my wanton pictures: <END>
balm his foul head in warm distilled waters <END>
and burn sweet wood to make the lodging sweet: <END>
procure me music ready when he wakes, <END>
to make a dulcet and a heavenly sound; <END>
and if he chance to speak, be ready straight <END>
and with a low submissive reverence <END>
say 'what is it your honour will command?' <END>
let one attend him with a silver basin <END>
full of rose-water and bestrew'd with flowers, <END>
another bear the ewer, the third a diaper, <END>
and say 'will't please your lordship cool your hands?' <END>
some one be ready with a costly suit <END>
and ask him what apparel he will wear; <END>
another tell him of his hounds and horse, <END>
and that his lady mourns at his disease: <END>
persuade him that he hath been lunatic; <END>
and when he says he is, say that he dreams, <END>
for he is nothing but a mighty lord. <END>
this do and do it kindly, gentle sirs: <END>
it will be pastime passing excellent, <END>
if it be husbanded with modesty. <END>
my lord, i warrant you we will play our part, <END>
as he shall think by our true diligence <END>
he is no less than what we say he is. <END>
take him up gently and to bed with him; <END>
and each one to his office when he wakes. <END>
sirrah, go see what trumpet 'tis that sounds: <END>
belike, some noble gentleman that means, <END>
travelling some journey, to repose him here. <END>
how now! who is it? <END>
an't please your honour, players <END>
that offer service to your lordship. <END>
bid them come near. <END>
now, fellows, you are welcome. <END>
we thank your honour. <END>
do you intend to stay with me tonight? <END>
a player: <END>
so please your lordship to accept our duty. <END>
with all my heart. this fellow i remember, <END>
since once he play'd a farmer's eldest son: <END>
'twas where you woo'd the gentlewoman so well: <END>
i have forgot your name; but, sure, that part <END>
was aptly fitted and naturally perform'd. <END>
a player: <END>
i think 'twas soto that your honour means. <END>
'tis very true: thou didst it excellent. <END>
well, you are come to me in a happy time; <END>
the rather for i have some sport in hand <END>
wherein your cunning can assist me much. <END>
there is a lord will hear you play to-night: <END>
but i am doubtful of your modesties; <END>
lest over-eyeing of his odd behavior,-- <END>
for yet his honour never heard a play-- <END>
you break into some merry passion <END>
and so offend him; for i tell you, sirs, <END>
if you should smile he grows impatient. <END>
a player: <END>
fear not, my lord: we can contain ourselves, <END>
were he the veriest antic in the world. <END>
go, sirrah, take them to the buttery, <END>
and give them friendly welcome every one: <END>
let them want nothing that my house affords. <END>
sirrah, go you to barthol'mew my page, <END>
and see him dress'd in all suits like a lady: <END>
that done, conduct him to the drunkard's chamber; <END>
and call him 'madam,' do him obeisance. <END>
tell him from me, as he will win my love, <END>
he bear himself with honourable action, <END>
such as he hath observed in noble ladies <END>
unto their lords, by them accomplished: <END>
such duty to the drunkard let him do <END>
with soft low tongue and lowly courtesy, <END>
and say 'what is't your honour will command, <END>
wherein your lady and your humble wife <END>
may show her duty and make known her love?' <END>
and then with kind embracements, tempting kisses, <END>
and with declining head into his bosom, <END>
bid him shed tears, as being overjoy'd <END>
to see her noble lord restored to health, <END>
who for this seven years hath esteem'd him <END>
no better than a poor and loathsome beggar: <END>
and if the boy have not a woman's gift <END>
to rain a shower of commanded tears, <END>
an onion will do well for such a shift, <END>
which in a napkin being close convey'd <END>
shall in despite enforce a watery eye. <END>
see this dispatch'd with all the haste thou canst: <END>
anon i'll give thee more instructions. <END>
i know the boy will well usurp the grace, <END>
voice, gait and action of a gentlewoman: <END>
i long to hear him call the drunkard husband, <END>
and how my men will stay themselves from laughter <END>
when they do homage to this simple peasant. <END>
i'll in to counsel them; haply my presence <END>
may well abate the over-merry spleen <END>
which otherwise would grow into extremes. <END>
for god's sake, a pot of small ale. <END>
will't please your lordship drink a cup of sack? <END>
will't please your honour taste of these conserves? <END>
what raiment will your honour wear to-day? <END>
i am christophero sly; call not me 'honour' nor <END>
'lordship:' i ne'er drank sack in my life; and if <END>
you give me any conserves, give me conserves of <END>
beef: ne'er ask me what raiment i'll wear; for i <END>
have no more doublets than backs, no more stockings <END>
than legs, nor no more shoes than feet; nay, <END>
sometimes more feet than shoes, or such shoes as my <END>
toes look through the over-leather. <END>
heaven cease this idle humour in your honour! <END>
o, that a mighty man of such descent, <END>
of such possessions and so high esteem, <END>
should be infused with so foul a spirit! <END>
what, would you make me mad? am not i christopher <END>
sly, old sly's son of burtonheath, by birth a <END>
pedlar, by education a cardmaker, by transmutation a <END>
bear-herd, and now by present profession a tinker? <END>
ask marian hacket, the fat ale-wife of wincot, if <END>
she know me not: if she say i am not fourteen pence <END>
on the score for sheer ale, score me up for the <END>
lyingest knave in christendom. what! i am not <END>
bestraught: here's-- <END>
o, this it is that makes your lady mourn! <END>
o, this is it that makes your servants droop! <END>
hence comes it that your kindred shuns your house, <END>
as beaten hence by your strange lunacy. <END>
o noble lord, bethink thee of thy birth, <END>
call home thy ancient thoughts from banishment <END>
and banish hence these abject lowly dreams. <END>
look how thy servants do attend on thee, <END>
each in his office ready at thy beck. <END>
wilt thou have music? hark! apollo plays, <END>
and twenty caged nightingales do sing: <END>
or wilt thou sleep? we'll have thee to a couch <END>
softer and sweeter than the lustful bed <END>
on purpose trimm'd up for semiramis. <END>
say thou wilt walk; we will bestrew the ground: <END>
or wilt thou ride? thy horses shall be trapp'd, <END>
their harness studded all with gold and pearl. <END>
dost thou love hawking? thou hast hawks will soar <END>
above the morning lark or wilt thou hunt? <END>
thy hounds shall make the welkin answer them <END>
and fetch shrill echoes from the hollow earth. <END>
say thou wilt course; thy greyhounds are as swift <END>
as breathed stags, ay, fleeter than the roe. <END>
dost thou love pictures? we will fetch thee straight <END>
adonis painted by a running brook, <END>
and cytherea all in sedges hid, <END>
which seem to move and wanton with her breath, <END>
even as the waving sedges play with wind. <END>
we'll show thee io as she was a maid, <END>
and how she was beguiled and surprised, <END>
as lively painted as the deed was done. <END>
or daphne roaming through a thorny wood, <END>
scratching her legs that one shall swear she bleeds, <END>
and at that sight shall sad apollo weep, <END>
so workmanly the blood and tears are drawn. <END>
thou art a lord, and nothing but a lord: <END>
thou hast a lady far more beautiful <END>
than any woman in this waning age. <END>
and till the tears that she hath shed for thee <END>
like envious floods o'er-run her lovely face, <END>
she was the fairest creature in the world; <END>
and yet she is inferior to none. <END>
am i a lord? and have i such a lady? <END>
or do i dream? or have i dream'd till now? <END>
i do not sleep: i see, i hear, i speak; <END>
i smell sweet savours and i feel soft things: <END>
upon my life, i am a lord indeed <END>
and not a tinker nor christophero sly. <END>
well, bring our lady hither to our sight; <END>
and once again, a pot o' the smallest ale. <END>
will't please your mightiness to wash your hands? <END>
o, how we joy to see your wit restored! <END>
o, that once more you knew but what you are! <END>
these fifteen years you have been in a dream; <END>
or when you waked, so waked as if you slept. <END>
these fifteen years! by my fay, a goodly nap. <END>
but did i never speak of all that time? <END>
o, yes, my lord, but very idle words: <END>
for though you lay here in this goodly chamber, <END>
yet would you say ye were beaten out of door; <END>
and rail upon the hostess of the house; <END>
and say you would present her at the leet, <END>
because she brought stone jugs and no seal'd quarts: <END>
sometimes you would call out for cicely hacket. <END>
ay, the woman's maid of the house. <END>
why, sir, you know no house nor no such maid, <END>
nor no such men as you have reckon'd up, <END>
as stephen sly and did john naps of greece <END>
and peter turph and henry pimpernell <END>
and twenty more such names and men as these <END>
which never were nor no man ever saw. <END>
now lord be thanked for my good amends! <END>
amen. <END>
i thank thee: thou shalt not lose by it. <END>
how fares my noble lord? <END>
marry, i fare well for here is cheer enough. <END>
where is my wife? <END>
here, noble lord: what is thy will with her? <END>
are you my wife and will not call me husband? <END>
my men should call me 'lord:' i am your goodman. <END>
my husband and my lord, my lord and husband; <END>
i am your wife in all obedience. <END>
i know it well. what must i call her? <END>
madam. <END>
al'ce madam, or joan madam? <END>
'madam,' and nothing else: so lords <END>
call ladies. <END>
madam wife, they say that i have dream'd <END>
and slept above some fifteen year or more. <END>
ay, and the time seems thirty unto me, <END>
being all this time abandon'd from your bed. <END>
'tis much. servants, leave me and her alone. <END>
madam, undress you and come now to bed. <END>
thrice noble lord, let me entreat of you <END>
to pardon me yet for a night or two, <END>
or, if not so, until the sun be set: <END>
for your physicians have expressly charged, <END>
in peril to incur your former malady, <END>
that i should yet absent me from your bed: <END>
i hope this reason stands for my excuse. <END>
ay, it stands so that i may hardly <END>
tarry so long. but i would be loath to fall into <END>
my dreams again: i will therefore tarry in <END>
despite of the flesh and the blood. <END>
your honour's players, heating your amendment, <END>
are come to play a pleasant comedy; <END>
for so your doctors hold it very meet, <END>
seeing too much sadness hath congeal'd your blood, <END>
and melancholy is the nurse of frenzy: <END>
therefore they thought it good you hear a play <END>
and frame your mind to mirth and merriment, <END>
which bars a thousand harms and lengthens life. <END>
marry, i will, let them play it. is not a <END>
comondy a christmas gambold or a tumbling-trick? <END>
no, my good lord; it is more pleasing stuff. <END>
what, household stuff? <END>
it is a kind of history. <END>
well, well see't. come, madam wife, sit by my side <END>
and let the world slip: we shall ne'er be younger. <END>
tranio, since for the great desire i had <END>
to see fair padua, nursery of arts, <END>
i am arrived for fruitful lombardy, <END>
the pleasant garden of great italy; <END>
and by my father's love and leave am arm'd <END>
with his good will and thy good company, <END>
my trusty servant, well approved in all, <END>
here let us breathe and haply institute <END>
a course of learning and ingenious studies. <END>
pisa renown'd for grave citizens <END>
gave me my being and my father first, <END>
a merchant of great traffic through the world, <END>
vincetino come of bentivolii. <END>
vincetino's son brought up in florence <END>
it shall become to serve all hopes conceived, <END>
to deck his fortune with his virtuous deeds: <END>
and therefore, tranio, for the time i study, <END>
virtue and that part of philosophy <END>
will i apply that treats of happiness <END>
by virtue specially to be achieved. <END>
tell me thy mind; for i have pisa left <END>
and am to padua come, as he that leaves <END>
a shallow plash to plunge him in the deep <END>
and with satiety seeks to quench his thirst. <END>
mi perdonato, gentle master mine, <END>
i am in all affected as yourself; <END>
glad that you thus continue your resolve <END>
to suck the sweets of sweet philosophy. <END>
only, good master, while we do admire <END>
this virtue and this moral discipline, <END>
let's be no stoics nor no stocks, i pray; <END>
or so devote to aristotle's cheques <END>
as ovid be an outcast quite abjured: <END>
balk logic with acquaintance that you have <END>
and practise rhetoric in your common talk; <END>
music and poesy use to quicken you; <END>
the mathematics and the metaphysics, <END>
fall to them as you find your stomach serves you; <END>
no profit grows where is no pleasure ta'en: <END>
in brief, sir, study what you most affect. <END>
gramercies, tranio, well dost thou advise. <END>
if, biondello, thou wert come ashore, <END>
we could at once put us in readiness, <END>
and take a lodging fit to entertain <END>
such friends as time in padua shall beget. <END>
but stay a while: what company is this? <END>
master, some show to welcome us to town. <END>
gentlemen, importune me no farther, <END>
for how i firmly am resolved you know; <END>
that is, not bestow my youngest daughter <END>
before i have a husband for the elder: <END>
if either of you both love katharina, <END>
because i know you well and love you well, <END>
leave shall you have to court her at your pleasure. <END>
i pray you, sir, is it your will <END>
to make a stale of me amongst these mates? <END>
mates, maid! how mean you that? no mates for you, <END>
unless you were of gentler, milder mould. <END>
i'faith, sir, you shall never need to fear: <END>
i wis it is not half way to her heart; <END>
but if it were, doubt not her care should be <END>
to comb your noddle with a three-legg'd stool <END>
and paint your face and use you like a fool. <END>
from all such devils, good lord deliver us! <END>
and me too, good lord! <END>
hush, master! here's some good pastime toward: <END>
that wench is stark mad or wonderful froward. <END>
but in the other's silence do i see <END>
maid's mild behavior and sobriety. <END>
peace, tranio! <END>
well said, master; mum! and gaze your fill. <END>
gentlemen, that i may soon make good <END>
what i have said, bianca, get you in: <END>
and let it not displease thee, good bianca, <END>
for i will love thee ne'er the less, my girl. <END>
a pretty peat! it is best <END>
put finger in the eye, an she knew why. <END>
sister, content you in my discontent. <END>
sir, to your pleasure humbly i subscribe: <END>
my books and instruments shall be my company, <END>
on them to took and practise by myself. <END>
hark, tranio! thou may'st hear minerva speak. <END>
signior baptista, will you be so strange? <END>
sorry am i that our good will effects <END>
bianca's grief. <END>
why will you mew her up, <END>
signior baptista, for this fiend of hell, <END>
and make her bear the penance of her tongue? <END>
gentlemen, content ye; i am resolved: <END>
go in, bianca: <END>
and for i know she taketh most delight <END>
in music, instruments and poetry, <END>
schoolmasters will i keep within my house, <END>
fit to instruct her youth. if you, hortensio, <END>
or signior gremio, you, know any such, <END>
prefer them hither; for to cunning men <END>
i will be very kind, and liberal <END>
to mine own children in good bringing up: <END>
and so farewell. katharina, you may stay; <END>
for i have more to commune with bianca. <END>
why, and i trust i may go too, may i not? what, <END>
shall i be appointed hours; as though, belike, i <END>
knew not what to take and what to leave, ha? <END>
you may go to the devil's dam: your gifts are so <END>
good, here's none will hold you. their love is not <END>
so great, hortensio, but we may blow our nails <END>
together, and fast it fairly out: our cakes dough on <END>
both sides. farewell: yet for the love i bear my <END>
sweet bianca, if i can by any means light on a fit <END>
man to teach her that wherein she delights, i will <END>
wish him to her father. <END>
so will i, signior gremio: but a word, i pray. <END>
though the nature of our quarrel yet never brooked <END>
parle, know now, upon advice, it toucheth us both, <END>
that we may yet again have access to our fair <END>
mistress and be happy rivals in bianco's love, to <END>
labour and effect one thing specially. <END>
what's that, i pray? <END>
marry, sir, to get a husband for her sister. <END>
a husband! a devil. <END>
i say, a husband. <END>
i say, a devil. thinkest thou, hortensio, though <END>
her father be very rich, any man is so very a fool <END>
to be married to hell? <END>
tush, gremio, though it pass your patience and mine <END>
to endure her loud alarums, why, man, there be good <END>
fellows in the world, an a man could light on them, <END>
would take her with all faults, and money enough. <END>
i cannot tell; but i had as lief take her dowry with <END>
this condition, to be whipped at the high cross <END>
every morning. <END>
faith, as you say, there's small choice in rotten <END>
apples. but come; since this bar in law makes us <END>
friends, it shall be so far forth friendly <END>
maintained all by helping baptista's eldest daughter <END>
to a husband we set his youngest free for a husband, <END>
and then have to't a fresh. sweet bianca! happy man <END>
be his dole! he that runs fastest gets the ring. <END>
how say you, signior gremio? <END>
i am agreed; and would i had given him the best <END>
horse in padua to begin his wooing that would <END>
thoroughly woo her, wed her and bed her and rid the <END>
house of her! come on. <END>
i pray, sir, tell me, is it possible <END>
that love should of a sudden take such hold? <END>
o tranio, till i found it to be true, <END>
i never thought it possible or likely; <END>
but see, while idly i stood looking on, <END>
i found the effect of love in idleness: <END>
and now in plainness do confess to thee, <END>
that art to me as secret and as dear <END>
as anna to the queen of carthage was, <END>
tranio, i burn, i pine, i perish, tranio, <END>
if i achieve not this young modest girl. <END>
counsel me, tranio, for i know thou canst; <END>
assist me, tranio, for i know thou wilt. <END>
master, it is no time to chide you now; <END>
affection is not rated from the heart: <END>
if love have touch'd you, nought remains but so, <END>
'redime te captum quam queas minimo.' <END>
gramercies, lad, go forward; this contents: <END>
the rest will comfort, for thy counsel's sound. <END>
master, you look'd so longly on the maid, <END>
perhaps you mark'd not what's the pith of all. <END>
o yes, i saw sweet beauty in her face, <END>
such as the daughter of agenor had, <END>
that made great jove to humble him to her hand. <END>
when with his knees he kiss'd the cretan strand. <END>
saw you no more? mark'd you not how her sister <END>
began to scold and raise up such a storm <END>
that mortal ears might hardly endure the din? <END>
tranio, i saw her coral lips to move <END>
and with her breath she did perfume the air: <END>
sacred and sweet was all i saw in her. <END>
nay, then, 'tis time to stir him from his trance. <END>
i pray, awake, sir: if you love the maid, <END>
bend thoughts and wits to achieve her. thus it stands: <END>
her eldest sister is so curst and shrewd <END>
that till the father rid his hands of her, <END>
master, your love must live a maid at home; <END>
and therefore has he closely mew'd her up, <END>
because she will not be annoy'd with suitors. <END>
ah, tranio, what a cruel father's he! <END>
but art thou not advised, he took some care <END>
to get her cunning schoolmasters to instruct her? <END>
ay, marry, am i, sir; and now 'tis plotted. <END>
i have it, tranio. <END>
master, for my hand, <END>
both our inventions meet and jump in one. <END>
tell me thine first. <END>
you will be schoolmaster <END>
and undertake the teaching of the maid: <END>
that's your device. <END>
it is: may it be done? <END>
not possible; for who shall bear your part, <END>
and be in padua here vincentio's son, <END>
keep house and ply his book, welcome his friends, <END>
visit his countrymen and banquet them? <END>
basta; content thee, for i have it full. <END>
we have not yet been seen in any house, <END>
nor can we lie distinguish'd by our faces <END>
for man or master; then it follows thus; <END>
thou shalt be master, tranio, in my stead, <END>
keep house and port and servants as i should: <END>
i will some other be, some florentine, <END>
some neapolitan, or meaner man of pisa. <END>
'tis hatch'd and shall be so: tranio, at once <END>
uncase thee; take my colour'd hat and cloak: <END>
when biondello comes, he waits on thee; <END>
but i will charm him first to keep his tongue. <END>
so had you need. <END>
in brief, sir, sith it your pleasure is, <END>
and i am tied to be obedient; <END>
for so your father charged me at our parting, <END>
'be serviceable to my son,' quoth he, <END>
although i think 'twas in another sense; <END>
i am content to be lucentio, <END>
because so well i love lucentio. <END>
tranio, be so, because lucentio loves: <END>
and let me be a slave, to achieve that maid <END>
whose sudden sight hath thrall'd my wounded eye. <END>
here comes the rogue. <END>
sirrah, where have you been? <END>
where have i been! nay, how now! where are you? <END>
master, has my fellow tranio stolen your clothes? or <END>
you stolen his? or both? pray, what's the news? <END>
sirrah, come hither: 'tis no time to jest, <END>
and therefore frame your manners to the time. <END>
your fellow tranio here, to save my life, <END>
puts my apparel and my countenance on, <END>
and i for my escape have put on his; <END>
for in a quarrel since i came ashore <END>
i kill'd a man and fear i was descried: <END>
wait you on him, i charge you, as becomes, <END>
while i make way from hence to save my life: <END>
you understand me? <END>
i, sir! ne'er a whit. <END>
and not a jot of tranio in your mouth: <END>
tranio is changed into lucentio. <END>
the better for him: would i were so too! <END>
so could i, faith, boy, to have the next wish after, <END>
that lucentio indeed had baptista's youngest daughter. <END>
but, sirrah, not for my sake, but your master's, i advise <END>
you use your manners discreetly in all kind of companies: <END>
when i am alone, why, then i am tranio; <END>
but in all places else your master lucentio. <END>
tranio, let's go: one thing more rests, that <END>
thyself execute, to make one among these wooers: if <END>
thou ask me why, sufficeth, my reasons are both good <END>
and weighty. <END>
my lord, you nod; you do not mind the play. <END>
yes, by saint anne, do i. a good matter, surely: <END>
comes there any more of it? <END>
my lord, 'tis but begun. <END>
'tis a very excellent piece of work, madam lady: <END>
would 'twere done! <END>
verona, for a while i take my leave, <END>
to see my friends in padua, but of all <END>
my best beloved and approved friend, <END>
hortensio; and i trow this is his house. <END>
here, sirrah grumio; knock, i say. <END>
knock, sir! whom should i knock? is there man has <END>
rebused your worship? <END>
villain, i say, knock me here soundly. <END>
knock you here, sir! why, sir, what am i, sir, that <END>
i should knock you here, sir? <END>
villain, i say, knock me at this gate <END>
and rap me well, or i'll knock your knave's pate. <END>
my master is grown quarrelsome. i should knock <END>
you first, <END>
and then i know after who comes by the worst. <END>
will it not be? <END>
faith, sirrah, an you'll not knock, i'll ring it; <END>
i'll try how you can sol, fa, and sing it. <END>
help, masters, help! my master is mad. <END>
now, knock when i bid you, sirrah villain! <END>
how now! what's the matter? my old friend grumio! <END>
and my good friend petruchio! how do you all at verona? <END>
signior hortensio, come you to part the fray? <END>
'con tutto il cuore, ben trovato,' may i say. <END>
'alla nostra casa ben venuto, molto honorato signor <END>
mio petruchio.' rise, grumio, rise: we will compound <END>
this quarrel. <END>
nay, 'tis no matter, sir, what he 'leges in latin. <END>
if this be not a lawful case for me to leave his <END>
service, look you, sir, he bid me knock him and rap <END>
him soundly, sir: well, was it fit for a servant to <END>
use his master so, being perhaps, for aught i see, <END>
two and thirty, a pip out? whom would to god i had <END>
well knock'd at first, then had not grumio come by the worst. <END>
a senseless villain! good hortensio, <END>
i bade the rascal knock upon your gate <END>
and could not get him for my heart to do it. <END>
knock at the gate! o heavens! spake you not these <END>
words plain, 'sirrah, knock me here, rap me here, <END>
knock me well, and knock me soundly'? and come you <END>
now with, 'knocking at the gate'? <END>
sirrah, be gone, or talk not, i advise you. <END>
petruchio, patience; i am grumio's pledge: <END>
why, this's a heavy chance 'twixt him and you, <END>
your ancient, trusty, pleasant servant grumio. <END>
and tell me now, sweet friend, what happy gale <END>
blows you to padua here from old verona? <END>
such wind as scatters young men through the world, <END>
to seek their fortunes farther than at home <END>
where small experience grows. but in a few, <END>
signior hortensio, thus it stands with me: <END>
antonio, my father, is deceased; <END>
and i have thrust myself into this maze, <END>
haply to wive and thrive as best i may: <END>
crowns in my purse i have and goods at home, <END>
and so am come abroad to see the world. <END>
petruchio, shall i then come roundly to thee <END>
and wish thee to a shrewd ill-favour'd wife? <END>
thou'ldst thank me but a little for my counsel: <END>
and yet i'll promise thee she shall be rich <END>
and very rich: but thou'rt too much my friend, <END>
and i'll not wish thee to her. <END>
signior hortensio, 'twixt such friends as we <END>
few words suffice; and therefore, if thou know <END>
one rich enough to be petruchio's wife, <END>
as wealth is burden of my wooing dance, <END>
be she as foul as was florentius' love, <END>
as old as sibyl and as curst and shrewd <END>
as socrates' xanthippe, or a worse, <END>
she moves me not, or not removes, at least, <END>
affection's edge in me, were she as rough <END>
as are the swelling adriatic seas: <END>
i come to wive it wealthily in padua; <END>
if wealthily, then happily in padua. <END>
nay, look you, sir, he tells you flatly what his <END>
mind is: why give him gold enough and marry him to <END>
a puppet or an aglet-baby; or an old trot with ne'er <END>
a tooth in her head, though she have as many diseases <END>
as two and fifty horses: why, nothing comes amiss, <END>
so money comes withal. <END>
petruchio, since we are stepp'd thus far in, <END>
i will continue that i broach'd in jest. <END>
i can, petruchio, help thee to a wife <END>
with wealth enough and young and beauteous, <END>
brought up as best becomes a gentlewoman: <END>
her only fault, and that is faults enough, <END>
is that she is intolerable curst <END>
and shrewd and froward, so beyond all measure <END>
that, were my state far worser than it is, <END>
i would not wed her for a mine of gold. <END>
hortensio, peace! thou know'st not gold's effect: <END>
tell me her father's name and 'tis enough; <END>
for i will board her, though she chide as loud <END>
as thunder when the clouds in autumn crack. <END>
her father is baptista minola, <END>
an affable and courteous gentleman: <END>
her name is katharina minola, <END>
renown'd in padua for her scolding tongue. <END>
i know her father, though i know not her; <END>
and he knew my deceased father well. <END>
i will not sleep, hortensio, till i see her; <END>
and therefore let me be thus bold with you <END>
to give you over at this first encounter, <END>
unless you will accompany me thither. <END>
i pray you, sir, let him go while the humour lasts. <END>
o' my word, an she knew him as well as i do, she <END>
would think scolding would do little good upon him: <END>
she may perhaps call him half a score knaves or so: <END>
why, that's nothing; an he begin once, he'll rail in <END>
his rope-tricks. i'll tell you what sir, an she <END>
stand him but a little, he will throw a figure in <END>
her face and so disfigure her with it that she <END>
shall have no more eyes to see withal than a cat. <END>
you know him not, sir. <END>
tarry, petruchio, i must go with thee, <END>
for in baptista's keep my treasure is: <END>
he hath the jewel of my life in hold, <END>
his youngest daughter, beautiful binaca, <END>
and her withholds from me and other more, <END>
suitors to her and rivals in my love, <END>
supposing it a thing impossible, <END>
for those defects i have before rehearsed, <END>
that ever katharina will be woo'd; <END>
therefore this order hath baptista ta'en, <END>
that none shall have access unto bianca <END>
till katharina the curst have got a husband. <END>
katharina the curst! <END>
a title for a maid of all titles the worst. <END>
now shall my friend petruchio do me grace, <END>
and offer me disguised in sober robes <END>
to old baptista as a schoolmaster <END>
well seen in music, to instruct bianca; <END>
that so i may, by this device, at least <END>
have leave and leisure to make love to her <END>
and unsuspected court her by herself. <END>
here's no knavery! see, to beguile the old folks, <END>
how the young folks lay their heads together! <END>
master, master, look about you: who goes there, ha? <END>
peace, grumio! it is the rival of my love. <END>
petruchio, stand by a while. <END>
a proper stripling and an amorous! <END>
o, very well; i have perused the note. <END>
hark you, sir: i'll have them very fairly bound: <END>
all books of love, see that at any hand; <END>
and see you read no other lectures to her: <END>
you understand me: over and beside <END>
signior baptista's liberality, <END>
i'll mend it with a largess. take your paper too, <END>
and let me have them very well perfumed <END>
for she is sweeter than perfume itself <END>
to whom they go to. what will you read to her? <END>
whate'er i read to her, i'll plead for you <END>
as for my patron, stand you so assured, <END>
as firmly as yourself were still in place: <END>
yea, and perhaps with more successful words <END>
than you, unless you were a scholar, sir. <END>
o this learning, what a thing it is! <END>
o this woodcock, what an ass it is! <END>
peace, sirrah! <END>
grumio, mum! god save you, signior gremio. <END>
and you are well met, signior hortensio. <END>
trow you whither i am going? to baptista minola. <END>
i promised to inquire carefully <END>
about a schoolmaster for the fair bianca: <END>
and by good fortune i have lighted well <END>
on this young man, for learning and behavior <END>
fit for her turn, well read in poetry <END>
and other books, good ones, i warrant ye. <END>
'tis well; and i have met a gentleman <END>
hath promised me to help me to another, <END>
a fine musician to instruct our mistress; <END>
so shall i no whit be behind in duty <END>
to fair bianca, so beloved of me. <END>
beloved of me; and that my deeds shall prove. <END>
and that his bags shall prove. <END>
gremio, 'tis now no time to vent our love: <END>
listen to me, and if you speak me fair, <END>
i'll tell you news indifferent good for either. <END>
here is a gentleman whom by chance i met, <END>
upon agreement from us to his liking, <END>
will undertake to woo curst katharina, <END>
yea, and to marry her, if her dowry please. <END>
so said, so done, is well. <END>
hortensio, have you told him all her faults? <END>
i know she is an irksome brawling scold: <END>
if that be all, masters, i hear no harm. <END>
no, say'st me so, friend? what countryman? <END>
born in verona, old antonio's son: <END>
my father dead, my fortune lives for me; <END>
and i do hope good days and long to see. <END>
o sir, such a life, with such a wife, were strange! <END>
but if you have a stomach, to't i' god's name: <END>
you shall have me assisting you in all. <END>
but will you woo this wild-cat? <END>
will i live? <END>
will he woo her? ay, or i'll hang her. <END>
why came i hither but to that intent? <END>
think you a little din can daunt mine ears? <END>
have i not in my time heard lions roar? <END>
have i not heard the sea puff'd up with winds <END>
rage like an angry boar chafed with sweat? <END>
have i not heard great ordnance in the field, <END>
and heaven's artillery thunder in the skies? <END>
have i not in a pitched battle heard <END>
loud 'larums, neighing steeds, and trumpets' clang? <END>
and do you tell me of a woman's tongue, <END>
that gives not half so great a blow to hear <END>
as will a chestnut in a farmer's fire? <END>
tush, tush! fear boys with bugs. <END>
for he fears none. <END>
hortensio, hark: <END>
this gentleman is happily arrived, <END>
my mind presumes, for his own good and ours. <END>
i promised we would be contributors <END>
and bear his charging of wooing, whatsoe'er. <END>
and so we will, provided that he win her. <END>
i would i were as sure of a good dinner. <END>
gentlemen, god save you. if i may be bold, <END>
tell me, i beseech you, which is the readiest way <END>
to the house of signior baptista minola? <END>
he that has the two fair daughters: is't he you mean? <END>
even he, biondello. <END>
hark you, sir; you mean not her to-- <END>
perhaps, him and her, sir: what have you to do? <END>
not her that chides, sir, at any hand, i pray. <END>
i love no chiders, sir. biondello, let's away. <END>
well begun, tranio. <END>
sir, a word ere you go; <END>
are you a suitor to the maid you talk of, yea or no? <END>
and if i be, sir, is it any offence? <END>
no; if without more words you will get you hence. <END>
why, sir, i pray, are not the streets as free <END>
for me as for you? <END>
but so is not she. <END>
for what reason, i beseech you? <END>
for this reason, if you'll know, <END>
that she's the choice love of signior gremio. <END>
that she's the chosen of signior hortensio. <END>
softly, my masters! if you be gentlemen, <END>
do me this right; hear me with patience. <END>
baptista is a noble gentleman, <END>
to whom my father is not all unknown; <END>
and were his daughter fairer than she is, <END>
she may more suitors have and me for one. <END>
fair leda's daughter had a thousand wooers; <END>
then well one more may fair bianca have: <END>
and so she shall; lucentio shall make one, <END>
though paris came in hope to speed alone. <END>
what! this gentleman will out-talk us all. <END>
sir, give him head: i know he'll prove a jade. <END>
hortensio, to what end are all these words? <END>
sir, let me be so bold as ask you, <END>
did you yet ever see baptista's daughter? <END>
no, sir; but hear i do that he hath two, <END>
the one as famous for a scolding tongue <END>
as is the other for beauteous modesty. <END>
sir, sir, the first's for me; let her go by. <END>
yea, leave that labour to great hercules; <END>
and let it be more than alcides' twelve. <END>
sir, understand you this of me in sooth: <END>
the youngest daughter whom you hearken for <END>
her father keeps from all access of suitors, <END>
and will not promise her to any man <END>
until the elder sister first be wed: <END>
the younger then is free and not before. <END>
if it be so, sir, that you are the man <END>
must stead us all and me amongst the rest, <END>
and if you break the ice and do this feat, <END>
achieve the elder, set the younger free <END>
for our access, whose hap shall be to have her <END>
will not so graceless be to be ingrate. <END>
sir, you say well and well you do conceive; <END>
and since you do profess to be a suitor, <END>
you must, as we do, gratify this gentleman, <END>
to whom we all rest generally beholding. <END>
sir, i shall not be slack: in sign whereof, <END>
please ye we may contrive this afternoon, <END>
and quaff carouses to our mistress' health, <END>
and do as adversaries do in law, <END>
strive mightily, but eat and drink as friends. <END>
o excellent motion! fellows, let's be gone. <END>
the motion's good indeed and be it so, <END>
petruchio, i shall be your ben venuto. <END>
good sister, wrong me not, nor wrong yourself, <END>
to make a bondmaid and a slave of me; <END>
that i disdain: but for these other gawds, <END>
unbind my hands, i'll pull them off myself, <END>
yea, all my raiment, to my petticoat; <END>
or what you will command me will i do, <END>
so well i know my duty to my elders. <END>
of all thy suitors, here i charge thee, tell <END>
whom thou lovest best: see thou dissemble not. <END>
believe me, sister, of all the men alive <END>
i never yet beheld that special face <END>
which i could fancy more than any other. <END>
minion, thou liest. is't not hortensio? <END>
if you affect him, sister, here i swear <END>
i'll plead for you myself, but you shall have <END>
him. <END>
o then, belike, you fancy riches more: <END>
you will have gremio to keep you fair. <END>
is it for him you do envy me so? <END>
nay then you jest, and now i well perceive <END>
you have but jested with me all this while: <END>
i prithee, sister kate, untie my hands. <END>
if that be jest, then all the rest was so. <END>
why, how now, dame! whence grows this insolence? <END>
bianca, stand aside. poor girl! she weeps. <END>
go ply thy needle; meddle not with her. <END>
for shame, thou helding of a devilish spirit, <END>
why dost thou wrong her that did ne'er wrong thee? <END>
when did she cross thee with a bitter word? <END>
her silence flouts me, and i'll be revenged. <END>
what, in my sight? bianca, get thee in. <END>
what, will you not suffer me? nay, now i see <END>
she is your treasure, she must have a husband; <END>
i must dance bare-foot on her wedding day <END>
and for your love to her lead apes in hell. <END>
talk not to me: i will go sit and weep <END>
till i can find occasion of revenge. <END>
was ever gentleman thus grieved as i? <END>
but who comes here? <END>
good morrow, neighbour baptista. <END>
good morrow, neighbour gremio. <END>
god save you, gentlemen! <END>
and you, good sir! pray, have you not a daughter <END>
call'd katharina, fair and virtuous? <END>
i have a daughter, sir, called katharina. <END>
you are too blunt: go to it orderly. <END>
you wrong me, signior gremio: give me leave. <END>
i am a gentleman of verona, sir, <END>
that, hearing of her beauty and her wit, <END>
her affability and bashful modesty, <END>
her wondrous qualities and mild behavior, <END>
am bold to show myself a forward guest <END>
within your house, to make mine eye the witness <END>
of that report which i so oft have heard. <END>
and, for an entrance to my entertainment, <END>
i do present you with a man of mine, <END>
cunning in music and the mathematics, <END>
to instruct her fully in those sciences, <END>
whereof i know she is not ignorant: <END>
accept of him, or else you do me wrong: <END>
his name is licio, born in mantua. <END>
you're welcome, sir; and he, for your good sake. <END>
but for my daughter katharina, this i know, <END>
she is not for your turn, the more my grief. <END>
i see you do not mean to part with her, <END>
or else you like not of my company. <END>
mistake me not; i speak but as i find. <END>
whence are you, sir? what may i call your name? <END>
petruchio is my name; antonio's son, <END>
a man well known throughout all italy. <END>
i know him well: you are welcome for his sake. <END>
saving your tale, petruchio, i pray, <END>
let us, that are poor petitioners, speak too: <END>
baccare! you are marvellous forward. <END>
o, pardon me, signior gremio; i would fain be doing. <END>
i doubt it not, sir; but you will curse your <END>
wooing. neighbour, this is a gift very grateful, i am <END>
sure of it. to express the like kindness, myself, <END>
that have been more kindly beholding to you than <END>
any, freely give unto you this young scholar, <END>
that hath been long studying at rheims; as cunning <END>
in greek, latin, and other languages, as the other <END>
in music and mathematics: his name is cambio; pray, <END>
accept his service. <END>
a thousand thanks, signior gremio. <END>
welcome, good cambio. <END>
but, gentle sir, methinks you walk like a stranger: <END>
may i be so bold to know the cause of your coming? <END>
pardon me, sir, the boldness is mine own, <END>
that, being a stranger in this city here, <END>
do make myself a suitor to your daughter, <END>
unto bianca, fair and virtuous. <END>
nor is your firm resolve unknown to me, <END>
in the preferment of the eldest sister. <END>
this liberty is all that i request, <END>
that, upon knowledge of my parentage, <END>
i may have welcome 'mongst the rest that woo <END>
and free access and favour as the rest: <END>
and, toward the education of your daughters, <END>
i here bestow a simple instrument, <END>
and this small packet of greek and latin books: <END>
if you accept them, then their worth is great. <END>
lucentio is your name; of whence, i pray? <END>
of pisa, sir; son to vincentio. <END>
a mighty man of pisa; by report <END>
i know him well: you are very welcome, sir, <END>
take you the lute, and you the set of books; <END>
you shall go see your pupils presently. <END>
holla, within! <END>
sirrah, lead these gentlemen <END>
to my daughters; and tell them both, <END>
these are their tutors: bid them use them well. <END>
we will go walk a little in the orchard, <END>
and then to dinner. you are passing welcome, <END>
and so i pray you all to think yourselves. <END>
signior baptista, my business asketh haste, <END>
and every day i cannot come to woo. <END>
you knew my father well, and in him me, <END>
left solely heir to all his lands and goods, <END>
which i have better'd rather than decreased: <END>
then tell me, if i get your daughter's love, <END>
what dowry shall i have with her to wife? <END>
after my death the one half of my lands, <END>
and in possession twenty thousand crowns. <END>
and, for that dowry, i'll assure her of <END>
her widowhood, be it that she survive me, <END>
in all my lands and leases whatsoever: <END>
let specialties be therefore drawn between us, <END>
that covenants may be kept on either hand. <END>
ay, when the special thing is well obtain'd, <END>
that is, her love; for that is all in all. <END>
why, that is nothing: for i tell you, father, <END>
i am as peremptory as she proud-minded; <END>
and where two raging fires meet together <END>
they do consume the thing that feeds their fury: <END>
though little fire grows great with little wind, <END>
yet extreme gusts will blow out fire and all: <END>
so i to her and so she yields to me; <END>
for i am rough and woo not like a babe. <END>
well mayst thou woo, and happy be thy speed! <END>
but be thou arm'd for some unhappy words. <END>
ay, to the proof; as mountains are for winds, <END>
that shake not, though they blow perpetually. <END>
how now, my friend! why dost thou look so pale? <END>
for fear, i promise you, if i look pale. <END>
what, will my daughter prove a good musician? <END>
i think she'll sooner prove a soldier <END>
iron may hold with her, but never lutes. <END>
why, then thou canst not break her to the lute? <END>
why, no; for she hath broke the lute to me. <END>
i did but tell her she mistook her frets, <END>
and bow'd her hand to teach her fingering; <END>
when, with a most impatient devilish spirit, <END>
'frets, call you these?' quoth she; 'i'll fume <END>
with them:' <END>
and, with that word, she struck me on the head, <END>
and through the instrument my pate made way; <END>
and there i stood amazed for a while, <END>
as on a pillory, looking through the lute; <END>
while she did call me rascal fiddler <END>
and twangling jack; with twenty such vile terms, <END>
as had she studied to misuse me so. <END>
now, by the world, it is a lusty wench; <END>
i love her ten times more than e'er i did: <END>
o, how i long to have some chat with her! <END>
well, go with me and be not so discomfited: <END>
proceed in practise with my younger daughter; <END>
she's apt to learn and thankful for good turns. <END>
signior petruchio, will you go with us, <END>
or shall i send my daughter kate to you? <END>
i pray you do. <END>
i will attend her here, <END>
and woo her with some spirit when she comes. <END>
say that she rail; why then i'll tell her plain <END>
she sings as sweetly as a nightingale: <END>
say that she frown, i'll say she looks as clear <END>
as morning roses newly wash'd with dew: <END>
say she be mute and will not speak a word; <END>
then i'll commend her volubility, <END>
and say she uttereth piercing eloquence: <END>
if she do bid me pack, i'll give her thanks, <END>
as though she bid me stay by her a week: <END>
if she deny to wed, i'll crave the day <END>
when i shall ask the banns and when be married. <END>
but here she comes; and now, petruchio, speak. <END>
good morrow, kate; for that's your name, i hear. <END>
well have you heard, but something hard of hearing: <END>
they call me katharina that do talk of me. <END>
you lie, in faith; for you are call'd plain kate, <END>
and bonny kate and sometimes kate the curst; <END>
but kate, the prettiest kate in christendom <END>
kate of kate hall, my super-dainty kate, <END>
for dainties are all kates, and therefore, kate, <END>
take this of me, kate of my consolation; <END>
hearing thy mildness praised in every town, <END>
thy virtues spoke of, and thy beauty sounded, <END>
yet not so deeply as to thee belongs, <END>
myself am moved to woo thee for my wife. <END>
moved! in good time: let him that moved you hither <END>
remove you hence: i knew you at the first <END>
you were a moveable. <END>
why, what's a moveable? <END>
a join'd-stool. <END>
thou hast hit it: come, sit on me. <END>
asses are made to bear, and so are you. <END>
women are made to bear, and so are you. <END>
no such jade as you, if me you mean. <END>
alas! good kate, i will not burden thee; <END>
for, knowing thee to be but young and light-- <END>
too light for such a swain as you to catch; <END>
and yet as heavy as my weight should be. <END>
should be! should--buzz! <END>
well ta'en, and like a buzzard. <END>
o slow-wing'd turtle! shall a buzzard take thee? <END>
ay, for a turtle, as he takes a buzzard. <END>
come, come, you wasp; i' faith, you are too angry. <END>
if i be waspish, best beware my sting. <END>
my remedy is then, to pluck it out. <END>
ay, if the fool could find it where it lies, <END>
who knows not where a wasp does <END>
wear his sting? in his tail. <END>
in his tongue. <END>
whose tongue? <END>
yours, if you talk of tails: and so farewell. <END>
what, with my tongue in your tail? nay, come again, <END>
good kate; i am a gentleman. <END>
that i'll try. <END>
i swear i'll cuff you, if you strike again. <END>
so may you lose your arms: <END>
if you strike me, you are no gentleman; <END>
and if no gentleman, why then no arms. <END>
a herald, kate? o, put me in thy books! <END>
what is your crest? a coxcomb? <END>
a combless cock, so kate will be my hen. <END>
no cock of mine; you crow too like a craven. <END>
nay, come, kate, come; you must not look so sour. <END>
it is my fashion, when i see a crab. <END>
why, here's no crab; and therefore look not sour. <END>
there is, there is. <END>
then show it me. <END>
had i a glass, i would. <END>
what, you mean my face? <END>
well aim'd of such a young one. <END>
now, by saint george, i am too young for you. <END>
yet you are wither'd. <END>
'tis with cares. <END>
i care not. <END>
nay, hear you, kate: in sooth you scape not so. <END>
i chafe you, if i tarry: let me go. <END>
no, not a whit: i find you passing gentle. <END>
'twas told me you were rough and coy and sullen, <END>
and now i find report a very liar; <END>
for thou are pleasant, gamesome, passing courteous, <END>
but slow in speech, yet sweet as spring-time flowers: <END>
thou canst not frown, thou canst not look askance, <END>
nor bite the lip, as angry wenches will, <END>
nor hast thou pleasure to be cross in talk, <END>
but thou with mildness entertain'st thy wooers, <END>
with gentle conference, soft and affable. <END>
why does the world report that kate doth limp? <END>
o slanderous world! kate like the hazel-twig <END>
is straight and slender and as brown in hue <END>
as hazel nuts and sweeter than the kernels. <END>
o, let me see thee walk: thou dost not halt. <END>
go, fool, and whom thou keep'st command. <END>
did ever dian so become a grove <END>
as kate this chamber with her princely gait? <END>
o, be thou dian, and let her be kate; <END>
and then let kate be chaste and dian sportful! <END>
where did you study all this goodly speech? <END>
it is extempore, from my mother-wit. <END>
a witty mother! witless else her son. <END>
am i not wise? <END>
yes; keep you warm. <END>
marry, so i mean, sweet katharina, in thy bed: <END>
and therefore, setting all this chat aside, <END>
thus in plain terms: your father hath consented <END>
that you shall be my wife; your dowry 'greed on; <END>
and, will you, nill you, i will marry you. <END>
now, kate, i am a husband for your turn; <END>
for, by this light, whereby i see thy beauty, <END>
thy beauty, that doth make me like thee well, <END>
thou must be married to no man but me; <END>
for i am he am born to tame you kate, <END>
and bring you from a wild kate to a kate <END>
conformable as other household kates. <END>
here comes your father: never make denial; <END>
i must and will have katharina to my wife. <END>
now, signior petruchio, how speed you with my daughter? <END>
how but well, sir? how but well? <END>
it were impossible i should speed amiss. <END>
why, how now, daughter katharina! in your dumps? <END>
call you me daughter? now, i promise you <END>
you have show'd a tender fatherly regard, <END>
to wish me wed to one half lunatic; <END>
a mad-cup ruffian and a swearing jack, <END>
that thinks with oaths to face the matter out. <END>
father, 'tis thus: yourself and all the world, <END>
that talk'd of her, have talk'd amiss of her: <END>
if she be curst, it is for policy, <END>
for she's not froward, but modest as the dove; <END>
she is not hot, but temperate as the morn; <END>
for patience she will prove a second grissel, <END>
and roman lucrece for her chastity: <END>
and to conclude, we have 'greed so well together, <END>
that upon sunday is the wedding-day. <END>
i'll see thee hang'd on sunday first. <END>
hark, petruchio; she says she'll see thee <END>
hang'd first. <END>
is this your speeding? nay, then, good night our part! <END>
be patient, gentlemen; i choose her for myself: <END>
if she and i be pleased, what's that to you? <END>
'tis bargain'd 'twixt us twain, being alone, <END>
that she shall still be curst in company. <END>
i tell you, 'tis incredible to believe <END>
how much she loves me: o, the kindest kate! <END>
she hung about my neck; and kiss on kiss <END>
she vied so fast, protesting oath on oath, <END>
that in a twink she won me to her love. <END>
o, you are novices! 'tis a world to see, <END>
how tame, when men and women are alone, <END>
a meacock wretch can make the curstest shrew. <END>
give me thy hand, kate: i will unto venice, <END>
to buy apparel 'gainst the wedding-day. <END>
provide the feast, father, and bid the guests; <END>
i will be sure my katharina shall be fine. <END>
i know not what to say: but give me your hands; <END>
god send you joy, petruchio! 'tis a match. <END>
amen, say we: we will be witnesses. <END>
father, and wife, and gentlemen, adieu; <END>
i will to venice; sunday comes apace: <END>
we will have rings and things and fine array; <END>
and kiss me, kate, we will be married o'sunday. <END>
was ever match clapp'd up so suddenly? <END>
faith, gentlemen, now i play a merchant's part, <END>
and venture madly on a desperate mart. <END>
'twas a commodity lay fretting by you: <END>
'twill bring you gain, or perish on the seas. <END>
the gain i seek is, quiet in the match. <END>
no doubt but he hath got a quiet catch. <END>
but now, baptists, to your younger daughter: <END>
now is the day we long have looked for: <END>
i am your neighbour, and was suitor first. <END>
and i am one that love bianca more <END>
than words can witness, or your thoughts can guess. <END>
youngling, thou canst not love so dear as i. <END>
graybeard, thy love doth freeze. <END>
but thine doth fry. <END>
skipper, stand back: 'tis age that nourisheth. <END>
but youth in ladies' eyes that flourisheth. <END>
content you, gentlemen: i will compound this strife: <END>
'tis deeds must win the prize; and he of both <END>
that can assure my daughter greatest dower <END>
shall have my bianca's love. <END>
say, signior gremio, what can you assure her? <END>
first, as you know, my house within the city <END>
is richly furnished with plate and gold; <END>
basins and ewers to lave her dainty hands; <END>
my hangings all of tyrian tapestry; <END>
in ivory coffers i have stuff'd my crowns; <END>
in cypress chests my arras counterpoints, <END>
costly apparel, tents, and canopies, <END>
fine linen, turkey cushions boss'd with pearl, <END>
valance of venice gold in needlework, <END>
pewter and brass and all things that belong <END>
to house or housekeeping: then, at my farm <END>
i have a hundred milch-kine to the pail, <END>
sixscore fat oxen standing in my stalls, <END>
and all things answerable to this portion. <END>
myself am struck in years, i must confess; <END>
and if i die to-morrow, this is hers, <END>
if whilst i live she will be only mine. <END>
that 'only' came well in. sir, list to me: <END>
i am my father's heir and only son: <END>
if i may have your daughter to my wife, <END>
i'll leave her houses three or four as good, <END>
within rich pisa walls, as any one <END>
old signior gremio has in padua; <END>
besides two thousand ducats by the year <END>
of fruitful land, all which shall be her jointure. <END>
what, have i pinch'd you, signior gremio? <END>
two thousand ducats by the year of land! <END>
my land amounts not to so much in all: <END>
that she shall have; besides an argosy <END>
that now is lying in marseilles' road. <END>
what, have i choked you with an argosy? <END>
gremio, 'tis known my father hath no less <END>
than three great argosies; besides two galliases, <END>
and twelve tight galleys: these i will assure her, <END>
and twice as much, whate'er thou offer'st next. <END>
nay, i have offer'd all, i have no more; <END>
and she can have no more than all i have: <END>
if you like me, she shall have me and mine. <END>
why, then the maid is mine from all the world, <END>
by your firm promise: gremio is out-vied. <END>
i must confess your offer is the best; <END>
and, let your father make her the assurance, <END>
she is your own; else, you must pardon me, <END>
if you should die before him, where's her dower? <END>
that's but a cavil: he is old, i young. <END>
and may not young men die, as well as old? <END>
well, gentlemen, <END>
i am thus resolved: on sunday next you know <END>
my daughter katharina is to be married: <END>
now, on the sunday following, shall bianca <END>
be bride to you, if you this assurance; <END>
if not, signior gremio: <END>
and so, i take my leave, and thank you both. <END>
adieu, good neighbour. <END>
now i fear thee not: <END>
sirrah young gamester, your father were a fool <END>
to give thee all, and in his waning age <END>
set foot under thy table: tut, a toy! <END>
an old italian fox is not so kind, my boy. <END>
a vengeance on your crafty wither'd hide! <END>
yet i have faced it with a card of ten. <END>
'tis in my head to do my master good: <END>
i see no reason but supposed lucentio <END>
must get a father, call'd 'supposed vincentio;' <END>
and that's a wonder: fathers commonly <END>
do get their children; but in this case of wooing, <END>
a child shall get a sire, if i fail not of my cunning. <END>
fiddler, forbear; you grow too forward, sir: <END>
have you so soon forgot the entertainment <END>
her sister katharina welcomed you withal? <END>
but, wrangling pedant, this is <END>
the patroness of heavenly harmony: <END>
then give me leave to have prerogative; <END>
and when in music we have spent an hour, <END>
your lecture shall have leisure for as much. <END>
preposterous ass, that never read so far <END>
to know the cause why music was ordain'd! <END>
was it not to refresh the mind of man <END>
after his studies or his usual pain? <END>
then give me leave to read philosophy, <END>
and while i pause, serve in your harmony. <END>
sirrah, i will not bear these braves of thine. <END>
why, gentlemen, you do me double wrong, <END>
to strive for that which resteth in my choice: <END>
i am no breeching scholar in the schools; <END>
i'll not be tied to hours nor 'pointed times, <END>
but learn my lessons as i please myself. <END>
and, to cut off all strife, here sit we down: <END>
take you your instrument, play you the whiles; <END>
his lecture will be done ere you have tuned. <END>
you'll leave his lecture when i am in tune? <END>
that will be never: tune your instrument. <END>
where left we last? <END>
here, madam: <END>
'hic ibat simois; hic est sigeia tellus; <END>
hic steterat priami regia celsa senis.' <END>
construe them. <END>
'hic ibat,' as i told you before, 'simois,' i am <END>
lucentio, 'hic est,' son unto vincentio of pisa, <END>
'sigeia tellus,' disguised thus to get your love; <END>
'hic steterat,' and that lucentio that comes <END>
a-wooing, 'priami,' is my man tranio, 'regia,' <END>
bearing my port, 'celsa senis,' that we might <END>
beguile the old pantaloon. <END>
madam, my instrument's in tune. <END>
let's hear. o fie! the treble jars. <END>
spit in the hole, man, and tune again. <END>
now let me see if i can construe it: 'hic ibat <END>
simois,' i know you not, 'hic est sigeia tellus,' i <END>
trust you not; 'hic steterat priami,' take heed <END>
he hear us not, 'regia,' presume not, 'celsa senis,' <END>
despair not. <END>
madam, 'tis now in tune. <END>
all but the base. <END>
the base is right; 'tis the base knave that jars. <END>
how fiery and forward our pedant is! <END>
now, for my life, the knave doth court my love: <END>
pedascule, i'll watch you better yet. <END>
in time i may believe, yet i mistrust. <END>
mistrust it not: for, sure, aeacides <END>
was ajax, call'd so from his grandfather. <END>
i must believe my master; else, i promise you, <END>
i should be arguing still upon that doubt: <END>
but let it rest. now, licio, to you: <END>
good masters, take it not unkindly, pray, <END>
that i have been thus pleasant with you both. <END>
you may go walk, and give me leave a while: <END>
my lessons make no music in three parts. <END>
are you so formal, sir? well, i must wait, <END>
and watch withal; for, but i be deceived, <END>
our fine musician groweth amorous. <END>
madam, before you touch the instrument, <END>
to learn the order of my fingering, <END>
i must begin with rudiments of art; <END>
to teach you gamut in a briefer sort, <END>
more pleasant, pithy and effectual, <END>
than hath been taught by any of my trade: <END>
and there it is in writing, fairly drawn. <END>
why, i am past my gamut long ago. <END>
yet read the gamut of hortensio. <END>
mistress, your father prays you leave your books <END>
and help to dress your sister's chamber up: <END>
you know to-morrow is the wedding-day. <END>
farewell, sweet masters both; i must be gone. <END>
faith, mistress, then i have no cause to stay. <END>
but i have cause to pry into this pedant: <END>
methinks he looks as though he were in love: <END>
yet if thy thoughts, bianca, be so humble <END>
to cast thy wandering eyes on every stale, <END>
seize thee that list: if once i find thee ranging, <END>
hortensio will be quit with thee by changing. <END>
no shame but mine: i must, forsooth, be forced <END>
to give my hand opposed against my heart <END>
unto a mad-brain rudesby full of spleen; <END>
who woo'd in haste and means to wed at leisure. <END>
i told you, i, he was a frantic fool, <END>
hiding his bitter jests in blunt behavior: <END>
and, to be noted for a merry man, <END>
he'll woo a thousand, 'point the day of marriage, <END>
make feasts, invite friends, and proclaim the banns; <END>
yet never means to wed where he hath woo'd. <END>
now must the world point at poor katharina, <END>
and say, 'lo, there is mad petruchio's wife, <END>
if it would please him come and marry her!' <END>
patience, good katharina, and baptista too. <END>
upon my life, petruchio means but well, <END>
whatever fortune stays him from his word: <END>
though he be blunt, i know him passing wise; <END>
though he be merry, yet withal he's honest. <END>
would katharina had never seen him though! <END>
go, girl; i cannot blame thee now to weep; <END>
for such an injury would vex a very saint, <END>
much more a shrew of thy impatient humour. <END>
master, master! news, old news, and such news as <END>
you never heard of! <END>
is it new and old too? how may that be? <END>
why, is it not news, to hear of petruchio's coming? <END>
is he come? <END>
why, no, sir. <END>
what then? <END>
he is coming. <END>
when will he be here? <END>
when he stands where i am and sees you there. <END>
but say, what to thine old news? <END>
why, petruchio is coming in a new hat and an old <END>
jerkin, a pair of old breeches thrice turned, a pair <END>
of boots that have been candle-cases, one buckled, <END>
another laced, an old rusty sword ta'en out of the <END>
town-armory, with a broken hilt, and chapeless; <END>
with two broken points: his horse hipped with an <END>
old mothy saddle and stirrups of no kindred; <END>
besides, possessed with the glanders and like to mose <END>
in the chine; troubled with the lampass, infected <END>
with the fashions, full of wingdalls, sped with <END>
spavins, rayed with yellows, past cure of the fives, <END>
stark spoiled with the staggers, begnawn with the <END>
bots, swayed in the back and shoulder-shotten; <END>
near-legged before and with, a half-chequed bit <END>
and a head-stall of sheeps leather which, being <END>
restrained to keep him from stumbling, hath been <END>
often burst and now repaired with knots; one girth <END>
six time pieced and a woman's crupper of velure, <END>
which hath two letters for her name fairly set down <END>
in studs, and here and there pieced with packthread. <END>
who comes with him? <END>
o, sir, his lackey, for all the world caparisoned <END>
like the horse; with a linen stock on one leg and a <END>
kersey boot-hose on the other, gartered with a red <END>
and blue list; an old hat and 'the humour of forty <END>
fancies' pricked in't for a feather: a monster, a <END>
very monster in apparel, and not like a christian <END>
footboy or a gentleman's lackey. <END>
'tis some odd humour pricks him to this fashion; <END>
yet oftentimes he goes but mean-apparell'd. <END>
i am glad he's come, howsoe'er he comes. <END>
why, sir, he comes not. <END>
didst thou not say he comes? <END>
who? that petruchio came? <END>
ay, that petruchio came. <END>
no, sir, i say his horse comes, with him on his back. <END>
why, that's all one. <END>
nay, by saint jamy, <END>
i hold you a penny, <END>
a horse and a man <END>
is more than one, <END>
and yet not many. <END>
come, where be these gallants? who's at home? <END>
you are welcome, sir. <END>
and yet i come not well. <END>
and yet you halt not. <END>
not so well apparell'd <END>
as i wish you were. <END>
were it better, i should rush in thus. <END>
but where is kate? where is my lovely bride? <END>
how does my father? gentles, methinks you frown: <END>
and wherefore gaze this goodly company, <END>
as if they saw some wondrous monument, <END>
some comet or unusual prodigy? <END>
why, sir, you know this is your wedding-day: <END>
first were we sad, fearing you would not come; <END>
now sadder, that you come so unprovided. <END>
fie, doff this habit, shame to your estate, <END>
an eye-sore to our solemn festival! <END>
and tells us, what occasion of import <END>
hath all so long detain'd you from your wife, <END>
and sent you hither so unlike yourself? <END>
tedious it were to tell, and harsh to hear: <END>
sufficeth i am come to keep my word, <END>
though in some part enforced to digress; <END>
which, at more leisure, i will so excuse <END>
as you shall well be satisfied withal. <END>
but where is kate? i stay too long from her: <END>
the morning wears, 'tis time we were at church. <END>
see not your bride in these unreverent robes: <END>
go to my chamber; put on clothes of mine. <END>
not i, believe me: thus i'll visit her. <END>
but thus, i trust, you will not marry her. <END>
good sooth, even thus; therefore ha' done with words: <END>
to me she's married, not unto my clothes: <END>
could i repair what she will wear in me, <END>
as i can change these poor accoutrements, <END>
'twere well for kate and better for myself. <END>
but what a fool am i to chat with you, <END>
when i should bid good morrow to my bride, <END>
and seal the title with a lovely kiss! <END>
he hath some meaning in his mad attire: <END>
we will persuade him, be it possible, <END>
to put on better ere he go to church. <END>
i'll after him, and see the event of this. <END>
but to her love concerneth us to add <END>
her father's liking: which to bring to pass, <END>
as i before unparted to your worship, <END>
i am to get a man,--whate'er he be, <END>
it skills not much. we'll fit him to our turn,-- <END>
and he shall be vincentio of pisa; <END>
and make assurance here in padua <END>
of greater sums than i have promised. <END>
so shall you quietly enjoy your hope, <END>
and marry sweet bianca with consent. <END>
were it not that my fellow-school-master <END>
doth watch bianca's steps so narrowly, <END>
'twere good, methinks, to steal our marriage; <END>
which once perform'd, let all the world say no, <END>
i'll keep mine own, despite of all the world. <END>
that by degrees we mean to look into, <END>
and watch our vantage in this business: <END>
we'll over-reach the greybeard, gremio, <END>
the narrow-prying father, minola, <END>
the quaint musician, amorous licio; <END>
all for my master's sake, lucentio. <END>
signior gremio, came you from the church? <END>
as willingly as e'er i came from school. <END>
and is the bride and bridegroom coming home? <END>
a bridegroom say you? 'tis a groom indeed, <END>
a grumbling groom, and that the girl shall find. <END>
curster than she? why, 'tis impossible. <END>
why he's a devil, a devil, a very fiend. <END>
why, she's a devil, a devil, the devil's dam. <END>
tut, she's a lamb, a dove, a fool to him! <END>
i'll tell you, sir lucentio: when the priest <END>
should ask, if katharina should be his wife, <END>
'ay, by gogs-wouns,' quoth he; and swore so loud, <END>
that, all-amazed, the priest let fall the book; <END>
and, as he stoop'd again to take it up, <END>
the mad-brain'd bridegroom took him such a cuff <END>
that down fell priest and book and book and priest: <END>
'now take them up,' quoth he, 'if any list.' <END>
what said the wench when he rose again? <END>
trembled and shook; for why, he stamp'd and swore, <END>
as if the vicar meant to cozen him. <END>
but after many ceremonies done, <END>
he calls for wine: 'a health!' quoth he, as if <END>
he had been aboard, carousing to his mates <END>
after a storm; quaff'd off the muscadel <END>
and threw the sops all in the sexton's face; <END>
having no other reason <END>
but that his beard grew thin and hungerly <END>
and seem'd to ask him sops as he was drinking. <END>
this done, he took the bride about the neck <END>
and kiss'd her lips with such a clamorous smack <END>
that at the parting all the church did echo: <END>
and i seeing this came thence for very shame; <END>
and after me, i know, the rout is coming. <END>
such a mad marriage never was before: <END>
hark, hark! i hear the minstrels play. <END>
gentlemen and friends, i thank you for your pains: <END>
i know you think to dine with me to-day, <END>
and have prepared great store of wedding cheer; <END>
but so it is, my haste doth call me hence, <END>
and therefore here i mean to take my leave. <END>
is't possible you will away to-night? <END>
i must away to-day, before night come: <END>
make it no wonder; if you knew my business, <END>
you would entreat me rather go than stay. <END>
and, honest company, i thank you all, <END>
that have beheld me give away myself <END>
to this most patient, sweet and virtuous wife: <END>
dine with my father, drink a health to me; <END>
for i must hence; and farewell to you all. <END>
let us entreat you stay till after dinner. <END>
it may not be. <END>
let me entreat you. <END>
it cannot be. <END>
let me entreat you. <END>
i am content. <END>
are you content to stay? <END>
i am content you shall entreat me stay; <END>
but yet not stay, entreat me how you can. <END>
now, if you love me, stay. <END>
grumio, my horse. <END>
ay, sir, they be ready: the oats have eaten the horses. <END>
nay, then, <END>
do what thou canst, i will not go to-day; <END>
no, nor to-morrow, not till i please myself. <END>
the door is open, sir; there lies your way; <END>
you may be jogging whiles your boots are green; <END>
for me, i'll not be gone till i please myself: <END>
'tis like you'll prove a jolly surly groom, <END>
that take it on you at the first so roundly. <END>
o kate, content thee; prithee, be not angry. <END>
i will be angry: what hast thou to do? <END>
father, be quiet; he shall stay my leisure. <END>
ay, marry, sir, now it begins to work. <END>
gentlemen, forward to the bridal dinner: <END>
i see a woman may be made a fool, <END>
if she had not a spirit to resist. <END>
they shall go forward, kate, at thy command. <END>
obey the bride, you that attend on her; <END>
go to the feast, revel and domineer, <END>
carouse full measure to her maidenhead, <END>
be mad and merry, or go hang yourselves: <END>
but for my bonny kate, she must with me. <END>
nay, look not big, nor stamp, nor stare, nor fret; <END>
i will be master of what is mine own: <END>
she is my goods, my chattels; she is my house, <END>
my household stuff, my field, my barn, <END>
my horse, my ox, my ass, my any thing; <END>
and here she stands, touch her whoever dare; <END>
i'll bring mine action on the proudest he <END>
that stops my way in padua. grumio, <END>
draw forth thy weapon, we are beset with thieves; <END>
rescue thy mistress, if thou be a man. <END>
fear not, sweet wench, they shall not touch <END>
thee, kate: <END>
i'll buckler thee against a million. <END>
nay, let them go, a couple of quiet ones. <END>
went they not quickly, i should die with laughing. <END>
of all mad matches never was the like. <END>
mistress, what's your opinion of your sister? <END>
that, being mad herself, she's madly mated. <END>
i warrant him, petruchio is kated. <END>
neighbours and friends, though bride and <END>
bridegroom wants <END>
for to supply the places at the table, <END>
you know there wants no junkets at the feast. <END>
lucentio, you shall supply the bridegroom's place: <END>
and let bianca take her sister's room. <END>
shall sweet bianca practise how to bride it? <END>
she shall, lucentio. come, gentlemen, let's go. <END>
fie, fie on all tired jades, on all mad masters, and <END>
all foul ways! was ever man so beaten? was ever <END>
man so rayed? was ever man so weary? i am sent <END>
before to make a fire, and they are coming after to <END>
warm them. now, were not i a little pot and soon <END>
hot, my very lips might freeze to my teeth, my <END>
tongue to the roof of my mouth, my heart in my <END>
belly, ere i should come by a fire to thaw me: but <END>
i, with blowing the fire, shall warm myself; for, <END>
considering the weather, a taller man than i will <END>
take cold. holla, ho! curtis. <END>
who is that calls so coldly? <END>
a piece of ice: if thou doubt it, thou mayst slide <END>
from my shoulder to my heel with no greater a run <END>
but my head and my neck. a fire good curtis. <END>
is my master and his wife coming, grumio? <END>
o, ay, curtis, ay: and therefore fire, fire; cast <END>
on no water. <END>
is she so hot a shrew as she's reported? <END>
she was, good curtis, before this frost: but, thou <END>
knowest, winter tames man, woman and beast; for it <END>
hath tamed my old master and my new mistress and <END>
myself, fellow curtis. <END>
away, you three-inch fool! i am no beast. <END>
am i but three inches? why, thy horn is a foot; and <END>
so long am i at the least. but wilt thou make a <END>
fire, or shall i complain on thee to our mistress, <END>
whose hand, she being now at hand, thou shalt soon <END>
feel, to thy cold comfort, for being slow in thy hot office? <END>
i prithee, good grumio, tell me, how goes the world? <END>
a cold world, curtis, in every office but thine; and <END>
therefore fire: do thy duty, and have thy duty; for <END>
my master and mistress are almost frozen to death. <END>
there's fire ready; and therefore, good grumio, the news. <END>
why, 'jack, boy! ho! boy!' and as much news as <END>
will thaw. <END>
come, you are so full of cony-catching! <END>
why, therefore fire; for i have caught extreme cold. <END>
where's the cook? is supper ready, the house <END>
trimmed, rushes strewed, cobwebs swept; the <END>
serving-men in their new fustian, their white <END>
stockings, and every officer his wedding-garment on? <END>
be the jacks fair within, the jills fair without, <END>
the carpets laid, and every thing in order? <END>
all ready; and therefore, i pray thee, news. <END>
first, know, my horse is tired; my master and <END>
mistress fallen out. <END>
how? <END>
out of their saddles into the dirt; and thereby <END>
hangs a tale. <END>
let's ha't, good grumio. <END>
lend thine ear. <END>
here. <END>
there. <END>
this is to feel a tale, not to hear a tale. <END>
and therefore 'tis called a sensible tale: and this <END>
cuff was but to knock at your ear, and beseech <END>
listening. now i begin: imprimis, we came down a <END>
foul hill, my master riding behind my mistress,-- <END>
both of one horse? <END>
what's that to thee? <END>
why, a horse. <END>
tell thou the tale: but hadst thou not crossed me, <END>
thou shouldst have heard how her horse fell and she <END>
under her horse; thou shouldst have heard in how <END>
miry a place, how she was bemoiled, how he left her <END>
with the horse upon her, how he beat me because <END>
her horse stumbled, how she waded through the dirt <END>
to pluck him off me, how he swore, how she prayed, <END>
that never prayed before, how i cried, how the <END>
horses ran away, how her bridle was burst, how i <END>
lost my crupper, with many things of worthy memory, <END>
which now shall die in oblivion and thou return <END>
unexperienced to thy grave. <END>
by this reckoning he is more shrew than she. <END>
ay; and that thou and the proudest of you all shall <END>
find when he comes home. but what talk i of this? <END>
call forth nathaniel, joseph, nicholas, philip, <END>
walter, sugarsop and the rest: let their heads be <END>
sleekly combed their blue coats brushed and their <END>
garters of an indifferent knit: let them curtsy <END>
with their left legs and not presume to touch a hair <END>
of my master's horse-tail till they kiss their <END>
hands. are they all ready? <END>
they are. <END>
call them forth. <END>
do you hear, ho? you must meet my master to <END>
countenance my mistress. <END>
why, she hath a face of her own. <END>
who knows not that? <END>
thou, it seems, that calls for company to <END>
countenance her. <END>
i call them forth to credit her. <END>
why, she comes to borrow nothing of them. <END>
welcome home, grumio! <END>
how now, grumio! <END>
what, grumio! <END>
fellow grumio! <END>
how now, old lad? <END>
welcome, you;--how now, you;-- what, you;--fellow, <END>
you;--and thus much for greeting. now, my spruce <END>
companions, is all ready, and all things neat? <END>
all things is ready. how near is our master? <END>
e'en at hand, alighted by this; and therefore be <END>
not--cock's passion, silence! i hear my master. <END>
where be these knaves? what, no man at door <END>
to hold my stirrup nor to take my horse! <END>
where is nathaniel, gregory, philip? <END>
all serving-men: <END>
here, here, sir; here, sir. <END>
here, sir! here, sir! here, sir! here, sir! <END>
you logger-headed and unpolish'd grooms! <END>
what, no attendance? no regard? no duty? <END>
where is the foolish knave i sent before? <END>
here, sir; as foolish as i was before. <END>
you peasant swain! you whoreson malt-horse drudge! <END>
did i not bid thee meet me in the park, <END>
and bring along these rascal knaves with thee? <END>
nathaniel's coat, sir, was not fully made, <END>
and gabriel's pumps were all unpink'd i' the heel; <END>
there was no link to colour peter's hat, <END>
and walter's dagger was not come from sheathing: <END>
there were none fine but adam, ralph, and gregory; <END>
the rest were ragged, old, and beggarly; <END>
yet, as they are, here are they come to meet you. <END>
go, rascals, go, and fetch my supper in. <END>
where is the life that late i led-- <END>
where are those--sit down, kate, and welcome.-- <END>
sound, sound, sound, sound! <END>
why, when, i say? nay, good sweet kate, be merry. <END>
off with my boots, you rogues! you villains, when? <END>
it was the friar of orders grey, <END>
as he forth walked on his way:-- <END>
out, you rogue! you pluck my foot awry: <END>
take that, and mend the plucking off the other. <END>
be merry, kate. some water, here; what, ho! <END>
where's my spaniel troilus? sirrah, get you hence, <END>
and bid my cousin ferdinand come hither: <END>
one, kate, that you must kiss, and be acquainted with. <END>
where are my slippers? shall i have some water? <END>
come, kate, and wash, and welcome heartily. <END>
you whoreson villain! will you let it fall? <END>
patience, i pray you; 'twas a fault unwilling. <END>
a whoreson beetle-headed, flap-ear'd knave! <END>
come, kate, sit down; i know you have a stomach. <END>
will you give thanks, sweet kate; or else shall i? <END>
what's this? mutton? <END>
ay. <END>
who brought it? <END>
i. <END>
'tis burnt; and so is all the meat. <END>
what dogs are these! where is the rascal cook? <END>
how durst you, villains, bring it from the dresser, <END>
and serve it thus to me that love it not? <END>
theretake it to you, trenchers, cups, and all; <END>
you heedless joltheads and unmanner'd slaves! <END>
what, do you grumble? i'll be with you straight. <END>
i pray you, husband, be not so disquiet: <END>
the meat was well, if you were so contented. <END>
i tell thee, kate, 'twas burnt and dried away; <END>
and i expressly am forbid to touch it, <END>
for it engenders choler, planteth anger; <END>
and better 'twere that both of us did fast, <END>
since, of ourselves, ourselves are choleric, <END>
than feed it with such over-roasted flesh. <END>
be patient; to-morrow 't shall be mended, <END>
and, for this night, we'll fast for company: <END>
come, i will bring thee to thy bridal chamber. <END>
peter, didst ever see the like? <END>
he kills her in her own humour. <END>
where is he? <END>
in her chamber, making a sermon of continency to her; <END>
and rails, and swears, and rates, that she, poor soul, <END>
knows not which way to stand, to look, to speak, <END>
and sits as one new-risen from a dream. <END>
away, away! for he is coming hither. <END>
thus have i politicly begun my reign, <END>
and 'tis my hope to end successfully. <END>
my falcon now is sharp and passing empty; <END>
and till she stoop she must not be full-gorged, <END>
for then she never looks upon her lure. <END>
another way i have to man my haggard, <END>
to make her come and know her keeper's call, <END>
that is, to watch her, as we watch these kites <END>
that bate and beat and will not be obedient. <END>
she eat no meat to-day, nor none shall eat; <END>
last night she slept not, nor to-night she shall not; <END>
as with the meat, some undeserved fault <END>
i'll find about the making of the bed; <END>
and here i'll fling the pillow, there the bolster, <END>
this way the coverlet, another way the sheets: <END>
ay, and amid this hurly i intend <END>
that all is done in reverend care of her; <END>
and in conclusion she shall watch all night: <END>
and if she chance to nod i'll rail and brawl <END>
and with the clamour keep her still awake. <END>
this is a way to kill a wife with kindness; <END>
and thus i'll curb her mad and headstrong humour. <END>
he that knows better how to tame a shrew, <END>
now let him speak: 'tis charity to show. <END>
is't possible, friend licio, that mistress bianca <END>
doth fancy any other but lucentio? <END>
i tell you, sir, she bears me fair in hand. <END>
sir, to satisfy you in what i have said, <END>
stand by and mark the manner of his teaching. <END>
now, mistress, profit you in what you read? <END>
what, master, read you? first resolve me that. <END>
i read that i profess, the art to love. <END>
and may you prove, sir, master of your art! <END>
while you, sweet dear, prove mistress of my heart! <END>
quick proceeders, marry! now, tell me, i pray, <END>
you that durst swear at your mistress bianca <END>
loved none in the world so well as lucentio. <END>
o despiteful love! unconstant womankind! <END>
i tell thee, licio, this is wonderful. <END>
mistake no more: i am not licio, <END>
nor a musician, as i seem to be; <END>
but one that scorn to live in this disguise, <END>
for such a one as leaves a gentleman, <END>
and makes a god of such a cullion: <END>
know, sir, that i am call'd hortensio. <END>
signior hortensio, i have often heard <END>
of your entire affection to bianca; <END>
and since mine eyes are witness of her lightness, <END>
i will with you, if you be so contented, <END>
forswear bianca and her love for ever. <END>
see, how they kiss and court! signior lucentio, <END>
here is my hand, and here i firmly vow <END>
never to woo her no more, but do forswear her, <END>
as one unworthy all the former favours <END>
that i have fondly flatter'd her withal. <END>
and here i take the unfeigned oath, <END>
never to marry with her though she would entreat: <END>
fie on her! see, how beastly she doth court him! <END>
would all the world but he had quite forsworn! <END>
for me, that i may surely keep mine oath, <END>
i will be married to a wealthy widow, <END>
ere three days pass, which hath as long loved me <END>
as i have loved this proud disdainful haggard. <END>
and so farewell, signior lucentio. <END>
kindness in women, not their beauteous looks, <END>
shall win my love: and so i take my leave, <END>
in resolution as i swore before. <END>
mistress bianca, bless you with such grace <END>
as 'longeth to a lover's blessed case! <END>
nay, i have ta'en you napping, gentle love, <END>
and have forsworn you with hortensio. <END>
tranio, you jest: but have you both forsworn me? <END>
mistress, we have. <END>
then we are rid of licio. <END>
i' faith, he'll have a lusty widow now, <END>
that shall be wood and wedded in a day. <END>
god give him joy! <END>
ay, and he'll tame her. <END>
he says so, tranio. <END>
faith, he is gone unto the taming-school. <END>
the taming-school! what, is there such a place? <END>
ay, mistress, and petruchio is the master; <END>
that teacheth tricks eleven and twenty long, <END>
to tame a shrew and charm her chattering tongue. <END>
o master, master, i have watch'd so long <END>
that i am dog-weary: but at last i spied <END>
an ancient angel coming down the hill, <END>
will serve the turn. <END>
what is he, biondello? <END>
master, a mercatante, or a pedant, <END>
i know not what; but format in apparel, <END>
in gait and countenance surely like a father. <END>
and what of him, tranio? <END>
if he be credulous and trust my tale, <END>
i'll make him glad to seem vincentio, <END>
and give assurance to baptista minola, <END>
as if he were the right vincentio <END>
take in your love, and then let me alone. <END>
god save you, sir! <END>
and you, sir! you are welcome. <END>
travel you far on, or are you at the farthest? <END>
sir, at the farthest for a week or two: <END>
but then up farther, and as for as rome; <END>
and so to tripoli, if god lend me life. <END>
what countryman, i pray? <END>
of mantua. <END>
of mantua, sir? marry, god forbid! <END>
and come to padua, careless of your life? <END>
my life, sir! how, i pray? for that goes hard. <END>
'tis death for any one in mantua <END>
to come to padua. know you not the cause? <END>
your ships are stay'd at venice, and the duke, <END>
for private quarrel 'twixt your duke and him, <END>
hath publish'd and proclaim'd it openly: <END>
'tis, marvel, but that you are but newly come, <END>
you might have heard it else proclaim'd about. <END>
alas! sir, it is worse for me than so; <END>
for i have bills for money by exchange <END>
from florence and must here deliver them. <END>
well, sir, to do you courtesy, <END>
this will i do, and this i will advise you: <END>
first, tell me, have you ever been at pisa? <END>
ay, sir, in pisa have i often been, <END>
pisa renowned for grave citizens. <END>
among them know you one vincentio? <END>
i know him not, but i have heard of him; <END>
a merchant of incomparable wealth. <END>
he is my father, sir; and, sooth to say, <END>
in countenance somewhat doth resemble you. <END>
to save your life in this extremity, <END>
this favour will i do you for his sake; <END>
and think it not the worst of an your fortunes <END>
that you are like to sir vincentio. <END>
his name and credit shall you undertake, <END>
and in my house you shall be friendly lodged: <END>
look that you take upon you as you should; <END>
you understand me, sir: so shall you stay <END>
till you have done your business in the city: <END>
if this be courtesy, sir, accept of it. <END>
o sir, i do; and will repute you ever <END>
the patron of my life and liberty. <END>
then go with me to make the matter good. <END>
this, by the way, i let you understand; <END>
my father is here look'd for every day, <END>
to pass assurance of a dower in marriage <END>
'twixt me and one baptista's daughter here: <END>
in all these circumstances i'll instruct you: <END>
go with me to clothe you as becomes you. <END>
no, no, forsooth; i dare not for my life. <END>
the more my wrong, the more his spite appears: <END>
what, did he marry me to famish me? <END>
beggars, that come unto my father's door, <END>
upon entreaty have a present aims; <END>
if not, elsewhere they meet with charity: <END>
but i, who never knew how to entreat, <END>
nor never needed that i should entreat, <END>
am starved for meat, giddy for lack of sleep, <END>
with oath kept waking and with brawling fed: <END>
and that which spites me more than all these wants, <END>
he does it under name of perfect love; <END>
as who should say, if i should sleep or eat, <END>
'twere deadly sickness or else present death. <END>
i prithee go and get me some repast; <END>
i care not what, so it be wholesome food. <END>
what say you to a neat's foot? <END>
'tis passing good: i prithee let me have it. <END>
i fear it is too choleric a meat. <END>
how say you to a fat tripe finely broil'd? <END>
i like it well: good grumio, fetch it me. <END>
i cannot tell; i fear 'tis choleric. <END>
what say you to a piece of beef and mustard? <END>
a dish that i do love to feed upon. <END>
ay, but the mustard is too hot a little. <END>
why then, the beef, and let the mustard rest. <END>
nay then, i will not: you shall have the mustard, <END>
or else you get no beef of grumio. <END>
then both, or one, or any thing thou wilt. <END>
why then, the mustard without the beef. <END>
go, get thee gone, thou false deluding slave, <END>
that feed'st me with the very name of meat: <END>
sorrow on thee and all the pack of you, <END>
that triumph thus upon my misery! <END>
go, get thee gone, i say. <END>
how fares my kate? what, sweeting, all amort? <END>
mistress, what cheer? <END>
faith, as cold as can be. <END>
pluck up thy spirits; look cheerfully upon me. <END>
here love; thou see'st how diligent i am <END>
to dress thy meat myself and bring it thee: <END>
i am sure, sweet kate, this kindness merits thanks. <END>
what, not a word? nay, then thou lovest it not; <END>
and all my pains is sorted to no proof. <END>
here, take away this dish. <END>
i pray you, let it stand. <END>
the poorest service is repaid with thanks; <END>
and so shall mine, before you touch the meat. <END>
i thank you, sir. <END>
signior petruchio, fie! you are to blame. <END>
come, mistress kate, i'll bear you company. <END>
here is the cap your worship did bespeak. <END>
why, this was moulded on a porringer; <END>
a velvet dish: fie, fie! 'tis lewd and filthy: <END>
why, 'tis a cockle or a walnut-shell, <END>
a knack, a toy, a trick, a baby's cap: <END>
away with it! come, let me have a bigger. <END>
i'll have no bigger: this doth fit the time, <END>
and gentlewomen wear such caps as these <END>
when you are gentle, you shall have one too, <END>
and not till then. <END>
why, sir, i trust i may have leave to speak; <END>
and speak i will; i am no child, no babe: <END>
your betters have endured me say my mind, <END>
and if you cannot, best you stop your ears. <END>
my tongue will tell the anger of my heart, <END>
or else my heart concealing it will break, <END>
and rather than it shall, i will be free <END>
even to the uttermost, as i please, in words. <END>
why, thou say'st true; it is a paltry cap, <END>
a custard-coffin, a bauble, a silken pie: <END>
i love thee well, in that thou likest it not. <END>
love me or love me not, i like the cap; <END>
and it i will have, or i will have none. <END>
thy gown? why, ay: come, tailor, let us see't. <END>
o mercy, god! what masquing stuff is here? <END>
what's this? a sleeve? 'tis like a demi-cannon: <END>
what, up and down, carved like an apple-tart? <END>
here's snip and nip and cut and slish and slash, <END>
like to a censer in a barber's shop: <END>
why, what, i' devil's name, tailor, call'st thou this? <END>
you bid me make it orderly and well, <END>
according to the fashion and the time. <END>
marry, and did; but if you be remember'd, <END>
i did not bid you mar it to the time. <END>
go, hop me over every kennel home, <END>
for you shall hop without my custom, sir: <END>
i'll none of it: hence! make your best of it. <END>
i never saw a better-fashion'd gown, <END>
more quaint, more pleasing, nor more commendable: <END>
belike you mean to make a puppet of me. <END>
why, true; he means to make a puppet of thee. <END>
she says your worship means to make <END>
a puppet of her. <END>
o monstrous arrogance! thou liest, thou thread, <END>
thou thimble, <END>
thou yard, three-quarters, half-yard, quarter, nail! <END>
thou flea, thou nit, thou winter-cricket thou! <END>
braved in mine own house with a skein of thread? <END>
away, thou rag, thou quantity, thou remnant; <END>
or i shall so be-mete thee with thy yard <END>
as thou shalt think on prating whilst thou livest! <END>
i tell thee, i, that thou hast marr'd her gown. <END>
your worship is deceived; the gown is made <END>
just as my master had direction: <END>
grumio gave order how it should be done. <END>
i gave him no order; i gave him the stuff. <END>
but how did you desire it should be made? <END>
marry, sir, with needle and thread. <END>
but did you not request to have it cut? <END>
thou hast faced many things. <END>
i have. <END>
face not me: thou hast braved many men; brave not <END>
me; i will neither be faced nor braved. i say unto <END>
thee, i bid thy master cut out the gown; but i did <END>
not bid him cut it to pieces: ergo, thou liest. <END>
why, here is the note of the fashion to testify <END>
read it. <END>
the note lies in's throat, if he say i said so. <END>
master, if ever i said loose-bodied gown, sew me in <END>
the skirts of it, and beat me to death with a bottom <END>
of brown thread: i said a gown. <END>
proceed. <END>
i confess the cape. <END>
i confess two sleeves. <END>
ay, there's the villany. <END>
error i' the bill, sir; error i' the bill. <END>
i commanded the sleeves should be cut out and <END>
sewed up again; and that i'll prove upon thee, <END>
though thy little finger be armed in a thimble. <END>
this is true that i say: an i had thee <END>
in place where, thou shouldst know it. <END>
i am for thee straight: take thou the <END>
bill, give me thy mete-yard, and spare not me. <END>
god-a-mercy, grumio! then he shall have no odds. <END>
well, sir, in brief, the gown is not for me. <END>
you are i' the right, sir: 'tis for my mistress. <END>
go, take it up unto thy master's use. <END>
villain, not for thy life: take up my mistress' <END>
gown for thy master's use! <END>
why, sir, what's your conceit in that? <END>
o, sir, the conceit is deeper than you think for: <END>
take up my mistress' gown to his master's use! <END>
o, fie, fie, fie! <END>
tailor, i'll pay thee for thy gown tomorrow: <END>
take no unkindness of his hasty words: <END>
away! i say; commend me to thy master. <END>
well, come, my kate; we will unto your father's <END>
even in these honest mean habiliments: <END>
our purses shall be proud, our garments poor; <END>
for 'tis the mind that makes the body rich; <END>
and as the sun breaks through the darkest clouds, <END>
so honour peereth in the meanest habit. <END>
what is the jay more precious than the lark, <END>
because his fathers are more beautiful? <END>
or is the adder better than the eel, <END>
because his painted skin contents the eye? <END>
o, no, good kate; neither art thou the worse <END>
for this poor furniture and mean array. <END>
if thou account'st it shame. lay it on me; <END>
and therefore frolic: we will hence forthwith, <END>
to feast and sport us at thy father's house. <END>
go, call my men, and let us straight to him; <END>
and bring our horses unto long-lane end; <END>
there will we mount, and thither walk on foot <END>
let's see; i think 'tis now some seven o'clock, <END>
and well we may come there by dinner-time. <END>
i dare assure you, sir, 'tis almost two; <END>
and 'twill be supper-time ere you come there. <END>
it shall be seven ere i go to horse: <END>
look, what i speak, or do, or think to do, <END>
you are still crossing it. sirs, let't alone: <END>
i will not go to-day; and ere i do, <END>
it shall be what o'clock i say it is. <END>
sir, this is the house: please it you that i call? <END>
ay, what else? and but i be deceived <END>
signior baptista may remember me, <END>
near twenty years ago, in genoa, <END>
where we were lodgers at the pegasus. <END>
'tis well; and hold your own, in any case, <END>
with such austerity as 'longeth to a father. <END>
i warrant you. <END>
but, sir, here comes your boy; <END>
'twere good he were school'd. <END>
fear you not him. sirrah biondello, <END>
now do your duty throughly, i advise you: <END>
imagine 'twere the right vincentio. <END>
tut, fear not me. <END>
but hast thou done thy errand to baptista? <END>
i told him that your father was at venice, <END>
and that you look'd for him this day in padua. <END>
thou'rt a tall fellow: hold thee that to drink. <END>
here comes baptista: set your countenance, sir. <END>
signior baptista, you are happily met. <END>
sir, this is the gentleman i told you of: <END>
i pray you stand good father to me now, <END>
give me bianca for my patrimony. <END>
soft son! <END>
sir, by your leave: having come to padua <END>
to gather in some debts, my son lucentio <END>
made me acquainted with a weighty cause <END>
of love between your daughter and himself: <END>
and, for the good report i hear of you <END>
and for the love he beareth to your daughter <END>
and she to him, to stay him not too long, <END>
i am content, in a good father's care, <END>
to have him match'd; and if you please to like <END>
no worse than i, upon some agreement <END>
me shall you find ready and willing <END>
with one consent to have her so bestow'd; <END>
for curious i cannot be with you, <END>
signior baptista, of whom i hear so well. <END>
sir, pardon me in what i have to say: <END>
your plainness and your shortness please me well. <END>
right true it is, your son lucentio here <END>
doth love my daughter and she loveth him, <END>
or both dissemble deeply their affections: <END>
and therefore, if you say no more than this, <END>
that like a father you will deal with him <END>
and pass my daughter a sufficient dower, <END>
the match is made, and all is done: <END>
your son shall have my daughter with consent. <END>
i thank you, sir. where then do you know best <END>
we be affied and such assurance ta'en <END>
as shall with either part's agreement stand? <END>
not in my house, lucentio; for, you know, <END>
pitchers have ears, and i have many servants: <END>
besides, old gremio is hearkening still; <END>
and happily we might be interrupted. <END>
then at my lodging, an it like you: <END>
there doth my father lie; and there, this night, <END>
we'll pass the business privately and well. <END>
send for your daughter by your servant here: <END>
my boy shall fetch the scrivener presently. <END>
the worst is this, that, at so slender warning, <END>
you are like to have a thin and slender pittance. <END>
it likes me well. biondello, hie you home, <END>
and bid bianca make her ready straight; <END>
and, if you will, tell what hath happened, <END>
lucentio's father is arrived in padua, <END>
and how she's like to be lucentio's wife. <END>
i pray the gods she may with all my heart! <END>
dally not with the gods, but get thee gone. <END>
signior baptista, shall i lead the way? <END>
welcome! one mess is like to be your cheer: <END>
come, sir; we will better it in pisa. <END>
i follow you. <END>
cambio! <END>
what sayest thou, biondello? <END>
you saw my master wink and laugh upon you? <END>
biondello, what of that? <END>
faith, nothing; but has left me here behind, to <END>
expound the meaning or moral of his signs and tokens. <END>
i pray thee, moralize them. <END>
then thus. baptista is safe, talking with the <END>
deceiving father of a deceitful son. <END>
and what of him? <END>
his daughter is to be brought by you to the supper. <END>
and then? <END>
the old priest of saint luke's church is at your <END>
command at all hours. <END>
and what of all this? <END>
i cannot tell; expect they are busied about a <END>
counterfeit assurance: take you assurance of her, <END>
'cum privilegio ad imprimendum solum:' to the <END>
church; take the priest, clerk, and some sufficient <END>
honest witnesses: if this be not that you look for, <END>
i have no more to say, but bid bianca farewell for <END>
ever and a day. <END>
hearest thou, biondello? <END>
i cannot tarry: i knew a wench married in an <END>
afternoon as she went to the garden for parsley to <END>
stuff a rabbit; and so may you, sir: and so, adieu, <END>
sir. my master hath appointed me to go to saint <END>
luke's, to bid the priest be ready to come against <END>
you come with your appendix. <END>
i may, and will, if she be so contented: <END>
she will be pleased; then wherefore should i doubt? <END>
hap what hap may, i'll roundly go about her: <END>
it shall go hard if cambio go without her. <END>
come on, i' god's name; once more toward our father's. <END>
good lord, how bright and goodly shines the moon! <END>
the moon! the sun: it is not moonlight now. <END>
i say it is the moon that shines so bright. <END>
i know it is the sun that shines so bright. <END>
now, by my mother's son, and that's myself, <END>
it shall be moon, or star, or what i list, <END>
or ere i journey to your father's house. <END>
go on, and fetch our horses back again. <END>
evermore cross'd and cross'd; nothing but cross'd! <END>
say as he says, or we shall never go. <END>
forward, i pray, since we have come so far, <END>
and be it moon, or sun, or what you please: <END>
an if you please to call it a rush-candle, <END>
henceforth i vow it shall be so for me. <END>
i say it is the moon. <END>
i know it is the moon. <END>
nay, then you lie: it is the blessed sun. <END>
then, god be bless'd, it is the blessed sun: <END>
but sun it is not, when you say it is not; <END>
and the moon changes even as your mind. <END>
what you will have it named, even that it is; <END>
and so it shall be so for katharina. <END>
petruchio, go thy ways; the field is won. <END>
well, forward, forward! thus the bowl should run, <END>
and not unluckily against the bias. <END>
but, soft! company is coming here. <END>
good morrow, gentle mistress: where away? <END>
tell me, sweet kate, and tell me truly too, <END>
hast thou beheld a fresher gentlewoman? <END>
such war of white and red within her cheeks! <END>
what stars do spangle heaven with such beauty, <END>
as those two eyes become that heavenly face? <END>
fair lovely maid, once more good day to thee. <END>
sweet kate, embrace her for her beauty's sake. <END>
a' will make the man mad, to make a woman of him. <END>
young budding virgin, fair and fresh and sweet, <END>
whither away, or where is thy abode? <END>
happy the parents of so fair a child; <END>
happier the man, whom favourable stars <END>
allot thee for his lovely bed-fellow! <END>
why, how now, kate! i hope thou art not mad: <END>
this is a man, old, wrinkled, faded, wither'd, <END>
and not a maiden, as thou say'st he is. <END>
pardon, old father, my mistaking eyes, <END>
that have been so bedazzled with the sun <END>
that everything i look on seemeth green: <END>
now i perceive thou art a reverend father; <END>
pardon, i pray thee, for my mad mistaking. <END>
do, good old grandsire; and withal make known <END>
which way thou travellest: if along with us, <END>
we shall be joyful of thy company. <END>
fair sir, and you my merry mistress, <END>
that with your strange encounter much amazed me, <END>
my name is call'd vincentio; my dwelling pisa; <END>
and bound i am to padua; there to visit <END>
a son of mine, which long i have not seen. <END>
what is his name? <END>
lucentio, gentle sir. <END>
happily we met; the happier for thy son. <END>
and now by law, as well as reverend age, <END>
i may entitle thee my loving father: <END>
the sister to my wife, this gentlewoman, <END>
thy son by this hath married. wonder not, <END>
nor be grieved: she is of good esteem, <END>
her dowery wealthy, and of worthy birth; <END>
beside, so qualified as may beseem <END>
the spouse of any noble gentleman. <END>
let me embrace with old vincentio, <END>
and wander we to see thy honest son, <END>
who will of thy arrival be full joyous. <END>
but is it true? or else is it your pleasure, <END>
like pleasant travellers, to break a jest <END>
upon the company you overtake? <END>
i do assure thee, father, so it is. <END>
come, go along, and see the truth hereof; <END>
for our first merriment hath made thee jealous. <END>
well, petruchio, this has put me in heart. <END>
have to my widow! and if she be froward, <END>
then hast thou taught hortensio to be untoward. <END>
softly and swiftly, sir; for the priest is ready. <END>
i fly, biondello: but they may chance to need thee <END>
at home; therefore leave us. <END>
nay, faith, i'll see the church o' your back; and <END>
then come back to my master's as soon as i can. <END>
i marvel cambio comes not all this while. <END>
sir, here's the door, this is lucentio's house: <END>
my father's bears more toward the market-place; <END>
thither must i, and here i leave you, sir. <END>
you shall not choose but drink before you go: <END>
i think i shall command your welcome here, <END>
and, by all likelihood, some cheer is toward. <END>
they're busy within; you were best knock louder. <END>
what's he that knocks as he would beat down the gate? <END>
is signior lucentio within, sir? <END>
he's within, sir, but not to be spoken withal. <END>
what if a man bring him a hundred pound or two, to <END>
make merry withal? <END>
keep your hundred pounds to yourself: he shall <END>
need none, so long as i live. <END>
nay, i told you your son was well beloved in padua. <END>
do you hear, sir? to leave frivolous circumstances, <END>
i pray you, tell signior lucentio that his father is <END>
come from pisa, and is here at the door to speak with him. <END>
thou liest: his father is come from padua and here <END>
looking out at the window. <END>
art thou his father? <END>
ay, sir; so his mother says, if i may believe her. <END>
lay hands on the villain: i believe a' means to <END>
cozen somebody in this city under my countenance. <END>
i have seen them in the church together: god send <END>
'em good shipping! but who is here? mine old <END>
master vincentio! now we are undone and brought to nothing. <END>
hope i may choose, sir. <END>
come hither, you rogue. what, have you forgot me? <END>
forgot you! no, sir: i could not forget you, for i <END>
never saw you before in all my life. <END>
what, you notorious villain, didst thou never see <END>
thy master's father, vincentio? <END>
what, my old worshipful old master? yes, marry, sir: <END>
see where he looks out of the window. <END>
is't so, indeed. <END>
help, help, help! here's a madman will murder me. <END>
help, son! help, signior baptista! <END>
prithee, kate, let's stand aside and see the end of <END>
this controversy. <END>
sir, what are you that offer to beat my servant? <END>
what am i, sir! nay, what are you, sir? o immortal <END>
gods! o fine villain! a silken doublet! a velvet <END>
hose! a scarlet cloak! and a copatain hat! o, i <END>
am undone! i am undone! while i play the good <END>
husband at home, my son and my servant spend all at <END>
the university. <END>
how now! what's the matter? <END>
what, is the man lunatic? <END>
sir, you seem a sober ancient gentleman by your <END>
habit, but your words show you a madman. why, sir, <END>
what 'cerns it you if i wear pearl and gold? i <END>
thank my good father, i am able to maintain it. <END>
thy father! o villain! he is a sailmaker in bergamo. <END>
you mistake, sir, you mistake, sir. pray, what do <END>
you think is his name? <END>
his name! as if i knew not his name: i have brought <END>
him up ever since he was three years old, and his <END>
name is tranio. <END>
away, away, mad ass! his name is lucentio and he is <END>
mine only son, and heir to the lands of me, signior vincentio. <END>
lucentio! o, he hath murdered his master! lay hold <END>
on him, i charge you, in the duke's name. o, my <END>
son, my son! tell me, thou villain, where is my son lucentio? <END>
call forth an officer. <END>
carry this mad knave to the gaol. father baptista, <END>
i charge you see that he be forthcoming. <END>
carry me to the gaol! <END>
stay, officer: he shall not go to prison. <END>
talk not, signior gremio: i say he shall go to prison. <END>
take heed, signior baptista, lest you be <END>
cony-catched in this business: i dare swear this <END>
is the right vincentio. <END>
swear, if thou darest. <END>
nay, i dare not swear it. <END>
then thou wert best say that i am not lucentio. <END>
yes, i know thee to be signior lucentio. <END>
away with the dotard! to the gaol with him! <END>
thus strangers may be hailed and abused: o <END>
monstrous villain! <END>
o! we are spoiled and--yonder he is: deny him, <END>
forswear him, or else we are all undone. <END>
lives my sweet son? <END>
pardon, dear father. <END>
how hast thou offended? <END>
where is lucentio? <END>
here's lucentio, <END>
right son to the right vincentio; <END>
that have by marriage made thy daughter mine, <END>
while counterfeit supposes bleared thine eyne. <END>
here's packing, with a witness to deceive us all! <END>
where is that damned villain tranio, <END>
that faced and braved me in this matter so? <END>
why, tell me, is not this my cambio? <END>
cambio is changed into lucentio. <END>
love wrought these miracles. bianca's love <END>
made me exchange my state with tranio, <END>
while he did bear my countenance in the town; <END>
and happily i have arrived at the last <END>
unto the wished haven of my bliss. <END>
what tranio did, myself enforced him to; <END>
then pardon him, sweet father, for my sake. <END>
i'll slit the villain's nose, that would have sent <END>
me to the gaol. <END>
but do you hear, sir? have you married my daughter <END>
without asking my good will? <END>
fear not, baptista; we will content you, go to: but <END>
i will in, to be revenged for this villany. <END>
and i, to sound the depth of this knavery. <END>
look not pale, bianca; thy father will not frown. <END>
my cake is dough; but i'll in among the rest, <END>
out of hope of all, but my share of the feast. <END>
husband, let's follow, to see the end of this ado. <END>
first kiss me, kate, and we will. <END>
what, in the midst of the street? <END>
what, art thou ashamed of me? <END>
no, sir, god forbid; but ashamed to kiss. <END>
why, then let's home again. come, sirrah, let's away. <END>
nay, i will give thee a kiss: now pray thee, love, stay. <END>
is not this well? come, my sweet kate: <END>
better once than never, for never too late. <END>
at last, though long, our jarring notes agree: <END>
and time it is, when raging war is done, <END>
to smile at scapes and perils overblown. <END>
my fair bianca, bid my father welcome, <END>
while i with self-same kindness welcome thine. <END>
brother petruchio, sister katharina, <END>
and thou, hortensio, with thy loving widow, <END>
feast with the best, and welcome to my house: <END>
my banquet is to close our stomachs up, <END>
after our great good cheer. pray you, sit down; <END>
for now we sit to chat as well as eat. <END>
nothing but sit and sit, and eat and eat! <END>
padua affords this kindness, son petruchio. <END>
padua affords nothing but what is kind. <END>
for both our sakes, i would that word were true. <END>
now, for my life, hortensio fears his widow. <END>
then never trust me, if i be afeard. <END>
you are very sensible, and yet you miss my sense: <END>
i mean, hortensio is afeard of you. <END>
he that is giddy thinks the world turns round. <END>
roundly replied. <END>
mistress, how mean you that? <END>
thus i conceive by him. <END>
conceives by me! how likes hortensio that? <END>
my widow says, thus she conceives her tale. <END>
very well mended. kiss him for that, good widow. <END>
'he that is giddy thinks the world turns round:' <END>
i pray you, tell me what you meant by that. <END>
your husband, being troubled with a shrew, <END>
measures my husband's sorrow by his woe: <END>
and now you know my meaning, <END>
a very mean meaning. <END>
right, i mean you. <END>
and i am mean indeed, respecting you. <END>
to her, kate! <END>
to her, widow! <END>
a hundred marks, my kate does put her down. <END>
that's my office. <END>
spoke like an officer; ha' to thee, lad! <END>
how likes gremio these quick-witted folks? <END>
believe me, sir, they butt together well. <END>
head, and butt! an hasty-witted body <END>
would say your head and butt were head and horn. <END>
ay, mistress bride, hath that awaken'd you? <END>
ay, but not frighted me; therefore i'll sleep again. <END>
nay, that you shall not: since you have begun, <END>
have at you for a bitter jest or two! <END>
am i your bird? i mean to shift my bush; <END>
and then pursue me as you draw your bow. <END>
you are welcome all. <END>
she hath prevented me. here, signior tranio. <END>
this bird you aim'd at, though you hit her not; <END>
therefore a health to all that shot and miss'd. <END>
o, sir, lucentio slipp'd me like his greyhound, <END>
which runs himself and catches for his master. <END>
a good swift simile, but something currish. <END>
'tis well, sir, that you hunted for yourself: <END>
'tis thought your deer does hold you at a bay. <END>
o ho, petruchio! tranio hits you now. <END>
i thank thee for that gird, good tranio. <END>
confess, confess, hath he not hit you here? <END>
a' has a little gall'd me, i confess; <END>
and, as the jest did glance away from me, <END>
'tis ten to one it maim'd you two outright. <END>
now, in good sadness, son petruchio, <END>
i think thou hast the veriest shrew of all. <END>
well, i say no: and therefore for assurance <END>
let's each one send unto his wife; <END>
and he whose wife is most obedient <END>
to come at first when he doth send for her, <END>
shall win the wager which we will propose. <END>
content. what is the wager? <END>
twenty crowns. <END>
twenty crowns! <END>
i'll venture so much of my hawk or hound, <END>
but twenty times so much upon my wife. <END>
a hundred then. <END>
content. <END>
a match! 'tis done. <END>
who shall begin? <END>
that will i. <END>
go, biondello, bid your mistress come to me. <END>
i go. <END>
son, i'll be your half, bianca comes. <END>
i'll have no halves; i'll bear it all myself. <END>
how now! what news? <END>
sir, my mistress sends you word <END>
that she is busy and she cannot come. <END>
how! she is busy and she cannot come! <END>
is that an answer? <END>
ay, and a kind one too: <END>
pray god, sir, your wife send you not a worse. <END>
i hope better. <END>
sirrah biondello, go and entreat my wife <END>
to come to me forthwith. <END>
o, ho! entreat her! <END>
nay, then she must needs come. <END>
i am afraid, sir, <END>
do what you can, yours will not be entreated. <END>
now, where's my wife? <END>
she says you have some goodly jest in hand: <END>
she will not come: she bids you come to her. <END>
worse and worse; she will not come! o vile, <END>
intolerable, not to be endured! <END>
sirrah grumio, go to your mistress; <END>
say, i command her to come to me. <END>
i know her answer. <END>
what? <END>
she will not. <END>
the fouler fortune mine, and there an end. <END>
now, by my holidame, here comes katharina! <END>
what is your will, sir, that you send for me? <END>
where is your sister, and hortensio's wife? <END>
they sit conferring by the parlor fire. <END>
go fetch them hither: if they deny to come. <END>
swinge me them soundly forth unto their husbands: <END>
away, i say, and bring them hither straight. <END>
here is a wonder, if you talk of a wonder. <END>
and so it is: i wonder what it bodes. <END>
marry, peace it bodes, and love and quiet life, <END>
and awful rule and right supremacy; <END>
and, to be short, what not, that's sweet and happy? <END>
now, fair befal thee, good petruchio! <END>
the wager thou hast won; and i will add <END>
unto their losses twenty thousand crowns; <END>
another dowry to another daughter, <END>
for she is changed, as she had never been. <END>
nay, i will win my wager better yet <END>
and show more sign of her obedience, <END>
her new-built virtue and obedience. <END>
see where she comes and brings your froward wives <END>
as prisoners to her womanly persuasion. <END>
katharina, that cap of yours becomes you not: <END>
off with that bauble, throw it under-foot. <END>
lord, let me never have a cause to sigh, <END>
till i be brought to such a silly pass! <END>
fie! what a foolish duty call you this? <END>
i would your duty were as foolish too: <END>
the wisdom of your duty, fair bianca, <END>
hath cost me an hundred crowns since supper-time. <END>
the more fool you, for laying on my duty. <END>
katharina, i charge thee, tell these headstrong women <END>
what duty they do owe their lords and husbands. <END>
come, come, you're mocking: we will have no telling. <END>
come on, i say; and first begin with her. <END>
she shall not. <END>
i say she shall: and first begin with her. <END>
fie, fie! unknit that threatening unkind brow, <END>
and dart not scornful glances from those eyes, <END>
to wound thy lord, thy king, thy governor: <END>
it blots thy beauty as frosts do bite the meads, <END>
confounds thy fame as whirlwinds shake fair buds, <END>
and in no sense is meet or amiable. <END>
a woman moved is like a fountain troubled, <END>
muddy, ill-seeming, thick, bereft of beauty; <END>
and while it is so, none so dry or thirsty <END>
will deign to sip or touch one drop of it. <END>
thy husband is thy lord, thy life, thy keeper, <END>
thy head, thy sovereign; one that cares for thee, <END>
and for thy maintenance commits his body <END>
to painful labour both by sea and land, <END>
to watch the night in storms, the day in cold, <END>
whilst thou liest warm at home, secure and safe; <END>
and craves no other tribute at thy hands <END>
but love, fair looks and true obedience; <END>
too little payment for so great a debt. <END>
such duty as the subject owes the prince <END>
even such a woman oweth to her husband; <END>
and when she is froward, peevish, sullen, sour, <END>
and not obedient to his honest will, <END>
what is she but a foul contending rebel <END>
and graceless traitor to her loving lord? <END>
i am ashamed that women are so simple <END>
to offer war where they should kneel for peace; <END>
or seek for rule, supremacy and sway, <END>
when they are bound to serve, love and obey. <END>
why are our bodies soft and weak and smooth, <END>
unapt to toil and trouble in the world, <END>
but that our soft conditions and our hearts <END>
should well agree with our external parts? <END>
come, come, you froward and unable worms! <END>
my mind hath been as big as one of yours, <END>
my heart as great, my reason haply more, <END>
to bandy word for word and frown for frown; <END>
but now i see our lances are but straws, <END>
our strength as weak, our weakness past compare, <END>
that seeming to be most which we indeed least are. <END>
then vail your stomachs, for it is no boot, <END>
and place your hands below your husband's foot: <END>
in token of which duty, if he please, <END>
my hand is ready; may it do him ease. <END>
why, there's a wench! come on, and kiss me, kate. <END>
well, go thy ways, old lad; for thou shalt ha't. <END>
'tis a good hearing when children are toward. <END>
but a harsh hearing when women are froward. <END>
come, kate, we'll to bed. <END>
we three are married, but you two are sped. <END>
'twas i won the wager, though you hit the white; <END>
and, being a winner, god give you good night! <END>
now, go thy ways; thou hast tamed a curst shrew. <END>
'tis a wonder, by your leave, she will be tamed so. <END>
boatswain! <END>
here, master: what cheer? <END>
good, speak to the mariners: fall to't, yarely, <END>
or we run ourselves aground: bestir, bestir. <END>
heigh, my hearts! cheerly, cheerly, my hearts! <END>
yare, yare! take in the topsail. tend to the <END>
master's whistle. blow, till thou burst thy wind, <END>
if room enough! <END>
good boatswain, have care. where's the master? <END>
play the men. <END>
i pray now, keep below. <END>
where is the master, boatswain? <END>
do you not hear him? you mar our labour: keep your <END>
cabins: you do assist the storm. <END>
nay, good, be patient. <END>
when the sea is. hence! what cares these roarers <END>
for the name of king? to cabin: silence! trouble us not. <END>
good, yet remember whom thou hast aboard. <END>
none that i more love than myself. you are a <END>
counsellor; if you can command these elements to <END>
silence, and work the peace of the present, we will <END>
not hand a rope more; use your authority: if you <END>
cannot, give thanks you have lived so long, and make <END>
yourself ready in your cabin for the mischance of <END>
the hour, if it so hap. cheerly, good hearts! out <END>
of our way, i say. <END>
i have great comfort from this fellow: methinks he <END>
hath no drowning mark upon him; his complexion is <END>
perfect gallows. stand fast, good fate, to his <END>
hanging: make the rope of his destiny our cable, <END>
for our own doth little advantage. if he be not <END>
born to be hanged, our case is miserable. <END>
down with the topmast! yare! lower, lower! bring <END>
her to try with main-course. <END>
a plague upon this howling! they are louder than <END>
the weather or our office. <END>
yet again! what do you here? shall we give o'er <END>
and drown? have you a mind to sink? <END>
a pox o' your throat, you bawling, blasphemous, <END>
incharitable dog! <END>
work you then. <END>
hang, cur! hang, you whoreson, insolent noisemaker! <END>
we are less afraid to be drowned than thou art. <END>
i'll warrant him for drowning; though the ship were <END>
no stronger than a nutshell and as leaky as an <END>
unstanched wench. <END>
lay her a-hold, a-hold! set her two courses off to <END>
sea again; lay her off. <END>
all lost! to prayers, to prayers! all lost! <END>
what, must our mouths be cold? <END>
the king and prince at prayers! let's assist them, <END>
for our case is as theirs. <END>
i'm out of patience. <END>
we are merely cheated of our lives by drunkards: <END>
this wide-chapp'd rascal--would thou mightst lie drowning <END>
the washing of ten tides! <END>
he'll be hang'd yet, <END>
though every drop of water swear against it <END>
and gape at widest to glut him. <END>
let's all sink with the king. <END>
let's take leave of him. <END>
now would i give a thousand furlongs of sea for an <END>
acre of barren ground, long heath, brown furze, any <END>
thing. the wills above be done! but i would fain <END>
die a dry death. <END>
if by your art, my dearest father, you have <END>
put the wild waters in this roar, allay them. <END>
the sky, it seems, would pour down stinking pitch, <END>
but that the sea, mounting to the welkin's cheek, <END>
dashes the fire out. o, i have suffered <END>
with those that i saw suffer: a brave vessel, <END>
who had, no doubt, some noble creature in her, <END>
dash'd all to pieces. o, the cry did knock <END>
against my very heart. poor souls, they perish'd. <END>
had i been any god of power, i would <END>
have sunk the sea within the earth or ere <END>
it should the good ship so have swallow'd and <END>
the fraughting souls within her. <END>
be collected: <END>
no more amazement: tell your piteous heart <END>
there's no harm done. <END>
o, woe the day! <END>
no harm. <END>
i have done nothing but in care of thee, <END>
of thee, my dear one, thee, my daughter, who <END>
art ignorant of what thou art, nought knowing <END>
of whence i am, nor that i am more better <END>
than prospero, master of a full poor cell, <END>
and thy no greater father. <END>
more to know <END>
did never meddle with my thoughts. <END>
'tis time <END>
i should inform thee farther. lend thy hand, <END>
and pluck my magic garment from me. so: <END>
lie there, my art. wipe thou thine eyes; have comfort. <END>
the direful spectacle of the wreck, which touch'd <END>
the very virtue of compassion in thee, <END>
i have with such provision in mine art <END>
so safely ordered that there is no soul-- <END>
no, not so much perdition as an hair <END>
betid to any creature in the vessel <END>
which thou heard'st cry, which thou saw'st sink. sit down; <END>
for thou must now know farther. <END>
you have often <END>
begun to tell me what i am, but stopp'd <END>
and left me to a bootless inquisition, <END>
concluding 'stay: not yet.' <END>
the hour's now come; <END>
the very minute bids thee ope thine ear; <END>
obey and be attentive. canst thou remember <END>
a time before we came unto this cell? <END>
i do not think thou canst, for then thou wast not <END>
out three years old. <END>
certainly, sir, i can. <END>
by what? by any other house or person? <END>
of any thing the image tell me that <END>
hath kept with thy remembrance. <END>
'tis far off <END>
and rather like a dream than an assurance <END>
that my remembrance warrants. had i not <END>
four or five women once that tended me? <END>
thou hadst, and more, miranda. but how is it <END>
that this lives in thy mind? what seest thou else <END>
in the dark backward and abysm of time? <END>
if thou remember'st aught ere thou camest here, <END>
how thou camest here thou mayst. <END>
but that i do not. <END>
twelve year since, miranda, twelve year since, <END>
thy father was the duke of milan and <END>
a prince of power. <END>
sir, are not you my father? <END>
thy mother was a piece of virtue, and <END>
she said thou wast my daughter; and thy father <END>
was duke of milan; and thou his only heir <END>
and princess no worse issued. <END>
o the heavens! <END>
what foul play had we, that we came from thence? <END>
or blessed was't we did? <END>
both, both, my girl: <END>
by foul play, as thou say'st, were we heaved thence, <END>
but blessedly holp hither. <END>
o, my heart bleeds <END>
to think o' the teen that i have turn'd you to, <END>
which is from my remembrance! please you, farther. <END>
my brother and thy uncle, call'd antonio-- <END>
i pray thee, mark me--that a brother should <END>
be so perfidious!--he whom next thyself <END>
of all the world i loved and to him put <END>
the manage of my state; as at that time <END>
through all the signories it was the first <END>
and prospero the prime duke, being so reputed <END>
in dignity, and for the liberal arts <END>
without a parallel; those being all my study, <END>
the government i cast upon my brother <END>
and to my state grew stranger, being transported <END>
and rapt in secret studies. thy false uncle-- <END>
dost thou attend me? <END>
sir, most heedfully. <END>
being once perfected how to grant suits, <END>
how to deny them, who to advance and who <END>
to trash for over-topping, new created <END>
the creatures that were mine, i say, or changed 'em, <END>
or else new form'd 'em; having both the key <END>
of officer and office, set all hearts i' the state <END>
to what tune pleased his ear; that now he was <END>
the ivy which had hid my princely trunk, <END>
and suck'd my verdure out on't. thou attend'st not. <END>
o, good sir, i do. <END>
i pray thee, mark me. <END>
i, thus neglecting worldly ends, all dedicated <END>
to closeness and the bettering of my mind <END>
with that which, but by being so retired, <END>
o'er-prized all popular rate, in my false brother <END>
awaked an evil nature; and my trust, <END>
like a good parent, did beget of him <END>
a falsehood in its contrary as great <END>
as my trust was; which had indeed no limit, <END>
a confidence sans bound. he being thus lorded, <END>
not only with what my revenue yielded, <END>
but what my power might else exact, like one <END>
who having into truth, by telling of it, <END>
made such a sinner of his memory, <END>
to credit his own lie, he did believe <END>
he was indeed the duke; out o' the substitution <END>
and executing the outward face of royalty, <END>
with all prerogative: hence his ambition growing-- <END>
dost thou hear? <END>
your tale, sir, would cure deafness. <END>
to have no screen between this part he play'd <END>
and him he play'd it for, he needs will be <END>
absolute milan. me, poor man, my library <END>
was dukedom large enough: of temporal royalties <END>
he thinks me now incapable; confederates-- <END>
so dry he was for sway--wi' the king of naples <END>
to give him annual tribute, do him homage, <END>
subject his coronet to his crown and bend <END>
the dukedom yet unbow'd--alas, poor milan!-- <END>
to most ignoble stooping. <END>
o the heavens! <END>
mark his condition and the event; then tell me <END>
if this might be a brother. <END>
i should sin <END>
to think but nobly of my grandmother: <END>
good wombs have borne bad sons. <END>
now the condition. <END>
the king of naples, being an enemy <END>
to me inveterate, hearkens my brother's suit; <END>
which was, that he, in lieu o' the premises <END>
of homage and i know not how much tribute, <END>
should presently extirpate me and mine <END>
out of the dukedom and confer fair milan <END>
with all the honours on my brother: whereon, <END>
a treacherous army levied, one midnight <END>
fated to the purpose did antonio open <END>
the gates of milan, and, i' the dead of darkness, <END>
the ministers for the purpose hurried thence <END>
me and thy crying self. <END>
alack, for pity! <END>
i, not remembering how i cried out then, <END>
will cry it o'er again: it is a hint <END>
that wrings mine eyes to't. <END>
hear a little further <END>
and then i'll bring thee to the present business <END>
which now's upon's; without the which this story <END>
were most impertinent. <END>
wherefore did they not <END>
that hour destroy us? <END>
well demanded, wench: <END>
my tale provokes that question. dear, they durst not, <END>
so dear the love my people bore me, nor set <END>
a mark so bloody on the business, but <END>
with colours fairer painted their foul ends. <END>
in few, they hurried us aboard a bark, <END>
bore us some leagues to sea; where they prepared <END>
a rotten carcass of a boat, not rigg'd, <END>
nor tackle, sail, nor mast; the very rats <END>
instinctively had quit it: there they hoist us, <END>
to cry to the sea that roar'd to us, to sigh <END>
to the winds whose pity, sighing back again, <END>
did us but loving wrong. <END>
alack, what trouble <END>
was i then to you! <END>
o, a cherubim <END>
thou wast that did preserve me. thou didst smile. <END>
infused with a fortitude from heaven, <END>
when i have deck'd the sea with drops full salt, <END>
under my burthen groan'd; which raised in me <END>
an undergoing stomach, to bear up <END>
against what should ensue. <END>
how came we ashore? <END>
by providence divine. <END>
some food we had and some fresh water that <END>
a noble neapolitan, gonzalo, <END>
out of his charity, being then appointed <END>
master of this design, did give us, with <END>
rich garments, linens, stuffs and necessaries, <END>
which since have steaded much; so, of his gentleness, <END>
knowing i loved my books, he furnish'd me <END>
from mine own library with volumes that <END>
i prize above my dukedom. <END>
would i might <END>
but ever see that man! <END>
now i arise: <END>
sit still, and hear the last of our sea-sorrow. <END>
here in this island we arrived; and here <END>
have i, thy schoolmaster, made thee more profit <END>
than other princesses can that have more time <END>
for vainer hours and tutors not so careful. <END>
heavens thank you for't! and now, i pray you, sir, <END>
for still 'tis beating in my mind, your reason <END>
for raising this sea-storm? <END>
know thus far forth. <END>
by accident most strange, bountiful fortune, <END>
now my dear lady, hath mine enemies <END>
brought to this shore; and by my prescience <END>
i find my zenith doth depend upon <END>
a most auspicious star, whose influence <END>
if now i court not but omit, my fortunes <END>
will ever after droop. here cease more questions: <END>
thou art inclined to sleep; 'tis a good dulness, <END>
and give it way: i know thou canst not choose. <END>
come away, servant, come. i am ready now. <END>
approach, my ariel, come. <END>
all hail, great master! grave sir, hail! i come <END>
to answer thy best pleasure; be't to fly, <END>
to swim, to dive into the fire, to ride <END>
on the curl'd clouds, to thy strong bidding task <END>
ariel and all his quality. <END>
hast thou, spirit, <END>
perform'd to point the tempest that i bade thee? <END>
to every article. <END>
i boarded the king's ship; now on the beak, <END>
now in the waist, the deck, in every cabin, <END>
i flamed amazement: sometime i'ld divide, <END>
and burn in many places; on the topmast, <END>
the yards and bowsprit, would i flame distinctly, <END>
then meet and join. jove's lightnings, the precursors <END>
o' the dreadful thunder-claps, more momentary <END>
and sight-outrunning were not; the fire and cracks <END>
of sulphurous roaring the most mighty neptune <END>
seem to besiege and make his bold waves tremble, <END>
yea, his dread trident shake. <END>
my brave spirit! <END>
who was so firm, so constant, that this coil <END>
would not infect his reason? <END>
not a soul <END>
but felt a fever of the mad and play'd <END>
some tricks of desperation. all but mariners <END>
plunged in the foaming brine and quit the vessel, <END>
then all afire with me: the king's son, ferdinand, <END>
with hair up-staring,--then like reeds, not hair,-- <END>
was the first man that leap'd; cried, 'hell is empty <END>
and all the devils are here.' <END>
why that's my spirit! <END>
but was not this nigh shore? <END>
close by, my master. <END>
but are they, ariel, safe? <END>
not a hair perish'd; <END>
on their sustaining garments not a blemish, <END>
but fresher than before: and, as thou badest me, <END>
in troops i have dispersed them 'bout the isle. <END>
the king's son have i landed by himself; <END>
whom i left cooling of the air with sighs <END>
in an odd angle of the isle and sitting, <END>
his arms in this sad knot. <END>
of the king's ship <END>
the mariners say how thou hast disposed <END>
and all the rest o' the fleet. <END>
safely in harbour <END>
is the king's ship; in the deep nook, where once <END>
thou call'dst me up at midnight to fetch dew <END>
from the still-vex'd bermoothes, there she's hid: <END>
the mariners all under hatches stow'd; <END>
who, with a charm join'd to their suffer'd labour, <END>
i have left asleep; and for the rest o' the fleet <END>
which i dispersed, they all have met again <END>
and are upon the mediterranean flote, <END>
bound sadly home for naples, <END>
supposing that they saw the king's ship wreck'd <END>
and his great person perish. <END>
ariel, thy charge <END>
exactly is perform'd: but there's more work. <END>
what is the time o' the day? <END>
past the mid season. <END>
at least two glasses. the time 'twixt six and now <END>
must by us both be spent most preciously. <END>
is there more toil? since thou dost give me pains, <END>
let me remember thee what thou hast promised, <END>
which is not yet perform'd me. <END>
how now? moody? <END>
what is't thou canst demand? <END>
my liberty. <END>
before the time be out? no more! <END>
i prithee, <END>
remember i have done thee worthy service; <END>
told thee no lies, made thee no mistakings, served <END>
without or grudge or grumblings: thou didst promise <END>
to bate me a full year. <END>
dost thou forget <END>
from what a torment i did free thee? <END>
no. <END>
thou dost, and think'st it much to tread the ooze <END>
of the salt deep, <END>
to run upon the sharp wind of the north, <END>
to do me business in the veins o' the earth <END>
when it is baked with frost. <END>
i do not, sir. <END>
thou liest, malignant thing! hast thou forgot <END>
the foul witch sycorax, who with age and envy <END>
was grown into a hoop? hast thou forgot her? <END>
no, sir. <END>
thou hast. where was she born? speak; tell me. <END>
sir, in argier. <END>
o, was she so? i must <END>
once in a month recount what thou hast been, <END>
which thou forget'st. this damn'd witch sycorax, <END>
for mischiefs manifold and sorceries terrible <END>
to enter human hearing, from argier, <END>
thou know'st, was banish'd: for one thing she did <END>
they would not take her life. is not this true? <END>
ay, sir. <END>
this blue-eyed hag was hither brought with child <END>
and here was left by the sailors. thou, my slave, <END>
as thou report'st thyself, wast then her servant; <END>
and, for thou wast a spirit too delicate <END>
to act her earthy and abhorr'd commands, <END>
refusing her grand hests, she did confine thee, <END>
by help of her more potent ministers <END>
and in her most unmitigable rage, <END>
into a cloven pine; within which rift <END>
imprison'd thou didst painfully remain <END>
a dozen years; within which space she died <END>
and left thee there; where thou didst vent thy groans <END>
as fast as mill-wheels strike. then was this island-- <END>
save for the son that she did litter here, <END>
a freckled whelp hag-born--not honour'd with <END>
a human shape. <END>
yes, caliban her son. <END>
dull thing, i say so; he, that caliban <END>
whom now i keep in service. thou best know'st <END>
what torment i did find thee in; thy groans <END>
did make wolves howl and penetrate the breasts <END>
of ever angry bears: it was a torment <END>
to lay upon the damn'd, which sycorax <END>
could not again undo: it was mine art, <END>
when i arrived and heard thee, that made gape <END>
the pine and let thee out. <END>
i thank thee, master. <END>
if thou more murmur'st, i will rend an oak <END>
and peg thee in his knotty entrails till <END>
thou hast howl'd away twelve winters. <END>
pardon, master; <END>
i will be correspondent to command <END>
and do my spiriting gently. <END>
do so, and after two days <END>
i will discharge thee. <END>
that's my noble master! <END>
what shall i do? say what; what shall i do? <END>
go make thyself like a nymph o' the sea: be subject <END>
to no sight but thine and mine, invisible <END>
to every eyeball else. go take this shape <END>
and hither come in't: go, hence with diligence! <END>
awake, dear heart, awake! thou hast slept well; awake! <END>
the strangeness of your story put <END>
heaviness in me. <END>
shake it off. come on; <END>
we'll visit caliban my slave, who never <END>
yields us kind answer. <END>
'tis a villain, sir, <END>
i do not love to look on. <END>
but, as 'tis, <END>
we cannot miss him: he does make our fire, <END>
fetch in our wood and serves in offices <END>
that profit us. what, ho! slave! caliban! <END>
thou earth, thou! speak. <END>
come forth, i say! there's other business for thee: <END>
come, thou tortoise! when? <END>
fine apparition! my quaint ariel, <END>
hark in thine ear. <END>
my lord it shall be done. <END>
thou poisonous slave, got by the devil himself <END>
upon thy wicked dam, come forth! <END>
as wicked dew as e'er my mother brush'd <END>
with raven's feather from unwholesome fen <END>
drop on you both! a south-west blow on ye <END>
and blister you all o'er! <END>
for this, be sure, to-night thou shalt have cramps, <END>
side-stitches that shall pen thy breath up; urchins <END>
shall, for that vast of night that they may work, <END>
all exercise on thee; thou shalt be pinch'd <END>
as thick as honeycomb, each pinch more stinging <END>
than bees that made 'em. <END>
i must eat my dinner. <END>
this island's mine, by sycorax my mother, <END>
which thou takest from me. when thou camest first, <END>
thou strokedst me and madest much of me, wouldst give me <END>
water with berries in't, and teach me how <END>
to name the bigger light, and how the less, <END>
that burn by day and night: and then i loved thee <END>
and show'd thee all the qualities o' the isle, <END>
the fresh springs, brine-pits, barren place and fertile: <END>
cursed be i that did so! all the charms <END>
of sycorax, toads, beetles, bats, light on you! <END>
for i am all the subjects that you have, <END>
which first was mine own king: and here you sty me <END>
in this hard rock, whiles you do keep from me <END>
the rest o' the island. <END>
thou most lying slave, <END>
whom stripes may move, not kindness! i have used thee, <END>
filth as thou art, with human care, and lodged thee <END>
in mine own cell, till thou didst seek to violate <END>
the honour of my child. <END>
o ho, o ho! would't had been done! <END>
thou didst prevent me; i had peopled else <END>
this isle with calibans. <END>
abhorred slave, <END>
which any print of goodness wilt not take, <END>
being capable of all ill! i pitied thee, <END>
took pains to make thee speak, taught thee each hour <END>
one thing or other: when thou didst not, savage, <END>
know thine own meaning, but wouldst gabble like <END>
a thing most brutish, i endow'd thy purposes <END>
with words that made them known. but thy vile race, <END>
though thou didst learn, had that in't which <END>
good natures <END>
could not abide to be with; therefore wast thou <END>
deservedly confined into this rock, <END>
who hadst deserved more than a prison. <END>
you taught me language; and my profit on't <END>
is, i know how to curse. the red plague rid you <END>
for learning me your language! <END>
hag-seed, hence! <END>
fetch us in fuel; and be quick, thou'rt best, <END>
to answer other business. shrug'st thou, malice? <END>
if thou neglect'st or dost unwillingly <END>
what i command, i'll rack thee with old cramps, <END>
fill all thy bones with aches, make thee roar <END>
that beasts shall tremble at thy din. <END>
no, pray thee. <END>
i must obey: his art is of such power, <END>
it would control my dam's god, setebos, <END>
and make a vassal of him. <END>
so, slave; hence! <END>
come unto these yellow sands, <END>
and then take hands: <END>
courtsied when you have and kiss'd <END>
the wild waves whist, <END>
foot it featly here and there; <END>
and, sweet sprites, the burthen bear. <END>
hark, hark! <END>
where should this music be? i' the air or the earth? <END>
it sounds no more: and sure, it waits upon <END>
some god o' the island. sitting on a bank, <END>
weeping again the king my father's wreck, <END>
this music crept by me upon the waters, <END>
allaying both their fury and my passion <END>
with its sweet air: thence i have follow'd it, <END>
or it hath drawn me rather. but 'tis gone. <END>
no, it begins again. <END>
full fathom five thy father lies; <END>
of his bones are coral made; <END>
those are pearls that were his eyes: <END>
nothing of him that doth fade <END>
but doth suffer a sea-change <END>
into something rich and strange. <END>
sea-nymphs hourly ring his knell <END>
hark! now i hear them,--ding-dong, bell. <END>
the ditty does remember my drown'd father. <END>
this is no mortal business, nor no sound <END>
that the earth owes. i hear it now above me. <END>
the fringed curtains of thine eye advance <END>
and say what thou seest yond. <END>
what is't? a spirit? <END>
lord, how it looks about! believe me, sir, <END>
it carries a brave form. but 'tis a spirit. <END>
no, wench; it eats and sleeps and hath such senses <END>
as we have, such. this gallant which thou seest <END>
was in the wreck; and, but he's something stain'd <END>
with grief that's beauty's canker, thou mightst call him <END>
a goodly person: he hath lost his fellows <END>
and strays about to find 'em. <END>
i might call him <END>
a thing divine, for nothing natural <END>
i ever saw so noble. <END>
most sure, the goddess <END>
on whom these airs attend! vouchsafe my prayer <END>
may know if you remain upon this island; <END>
and that you will some good instruction give <END>
how i may bear me here: my prime request, <END>
which i do last pronounce, is, o you wonder! <END>
if you be maid or no? <END>
no wonder, sir; <END>
but certainly a maid. <END>
my language! heavens! <END>
i am the best of them that speak this speech, <END>
were i but where 'tis spoken. <END>
how? the best? <END>
what wert thou, if the king of naples heard thee? <END>
a single thing, as i am now, that wonders <END>
to hear thee speak of naples. he does hear me; <END>
and that he does i weep: myself am naples, <END>
who with mine eyes, never since at ebb, beheld <END>
the king my father wreck'd. <END>
alack, for mercy! <END>
yes, faith, and all his lords; the duke of milan <END>
and his brave son being twain. <END>
why speaks my father so ungently? this <END>
is the third man that e'er i saw, the first <END>
that e'er i sigh'd for: pity move my father <END>
to be inclined my way! <END>
o, if a virgin, <END>
and your affection not gone forth, i'll make you <END>
the queen of naples. <END>
soft, sir! one word more. <END>
they are both in either's powers; but this swift business <END>
i must uneasy make, lest too light winning <END>
make the prize light. <END>
one word more; i charge thee <END>
that thou attend me: thou dost here usurp <END>
the name thou owest not; and hast put thyself <END>
upon this island as a spy, to win it <END>
from me, the lord on't. <END>
no, as i am a man. <END>
there's nothing ill can dwell in such a temple: <END>
if the ill spirit have so fair a house, <END>
good things will strive to dwell with't. <END>
follow me. <END>
speak not you for him; he's a traitor. come; <END>
i'll manacle thy neck and feet together: <END>
sea-water shalt thou drink; thy food shall be <END>
the fresh-brook muscles, wither'd roots and husks <END>
wherein the acorn cradled. follow. <END>
no; <END>
i will resist such entertainment till <END>
mine enemy has more power. <END>
o dear father, <END>
make not too rash a trial of him, for <END>
he's gentle and not fearful. <END>
what? i say, <END>
my foot my tutor? put thy sword up, traitor; <END>
who makest a show but darest not strike, thy conscience <END>
is so possess'd with guilt: come from thy ward, <END>
for i can here disarm thee with this stick <END>
and make thy weapon drop. <END>
beseech you, father. <END>
hence! hang not on my garments. <END>
sir, have pity; <END>
i'll be his surety. <END>
silence! one word more <END>
shall make me chide thee, if not hate thee. what! <END>
an advocate for an imposter! hush! <END>
thou think'st there is no more such shapes as he, <END>
having seen but him and caliban: foolish wench! <END>
to the most of men this is a caliban <END>
and they to him are angels. <END>
my affections <END>
are then most humble; i have no ambition <END>
to see a goodlier man. <END>
come on; obey: <END>
thy nerves are in their infancy again <END>
and have no vigour in them. <END>
so they are; <END>
my spirits, as in a dream, are all bound up. <END>
my father's loss, the weakness which i feel, <END>
the wreck of all my friends, nor this man's threats, <END>
to whom i am subdued, are but light to me, <END>
might i but through my prison once a day <END>
behold this maid: all corners else o' the earth <END>
let liberty make use of; space enough <END>
have i in such a prison. <END>
be of comfort; <END>
my father's of a better nature, sir, <END>
than he appears by speech: this is unwonted <END>
which now came from him. <END>
thou shalt be free <END>
as mountain winds: but then exactly do <END>
all points of my command. <END>
to the syllable. <END>
come, follow. speak not for him. <END>
beseech you, sir, be merry; you have cause, <END>
so have we all, of joy; for our escape <END>
is much beyond our loss. our hint of woe <END>
is common; every day some sailor's wife, <END>
the masters of some merchant and the merchant <END>
have just our theme of woe; but for the miracle, <END>
i mean our preservation, few in millions <END>
can speak like us: then wisely, good sir, weigh <END>
our sorrow with our comfort. <END>
prithee, peace. <END>
he receives comfort like cold porridge. <END>
the visitor will not give him o'er so. <END>
look he's winding up the watch of his wit; <END>
by and by it will strike. <END>
sir,-- <END>
when every grief is entertain'd that's offer'd, <END>
comes to the entertainer-- <END>
a dollar. <END>
dolour comes to him, indeed: you <END>
have spoken truer than you purposed. <END>
you have taken it wiselier than i meant you should. <END>
therefore, my lord,-- <END>
fie, what a spendthrift is he of his tongue! <END>
i prithee, spare. <END>
well, i have done: but yet,-- <END>
he will be talking. <END>
which, of he or adrian, for a good <END>
wager, first begins to crow? <END>
the old cock. <END>
the cockerel. <END>
done. the wager? <END>
a laughter. <END>
a match! <END>
though this island seem to be desert,-- <END>
ha, ha, ha! so, you're paid. <END>
uninhabitable and almost inaccessible,-- <END>
yet,-- <END>
yet,-- <END>
he could not miss't. <END>
it must needs be of subtle, tender and delicate <END>
temperance. <END>
temperance was a delicate wench. <END>
ay, and a subtle; as he most learnedly delivered. <END>
the air breathes upon us here most sweetly. <END>
as if it had lungs and rotten ones. <END>
or as 'twere perfumed by a fen. <END>
here is everything advantageous to life. <END>
true; save means to live. <END>
of that there's none, or little. <END>
how lush and lusty the grass looks! how green! <END>
the ground indeed is tawny. <END>
with an eye of green in't. <END>
he misses not much. <END>
no; he doth but mistake the truth totally. <END>
but the rarity of it is,--which is indeed almost <END>
beyond credit,-- <END>
as many vouched rarities are. <END>
that our garments, being, as they were, drenched in <END>
the sea, hold notwithstanding their freshness and <END>
glosses, being rather new-dyed than stained with <END>
salt water. <END>
if but one of his pockets could speak, would it not <END>
say he lies? <END>
ay, or very falsely pocket up his report <END>
methinks our garments are now as fresh as when we <END>
put them on first in afric, at the marriage of <END>
the king's fair daughter claribel to the king of tunis. <END>
'twas a sweet marriage, and we prosper well in our return. <END>
tunis was never graced before with such a paragon to <END>
their queen. <END>
not since widow dido's time. <END>
widow! a pox o' that! how came that widow in? <END>
widow dido! <END>
what if he had said 'widower aeneas' too? good lord, <END>
how you take it! <END>
'widow dido' said you? you make me study of that: <END>
she was of carthage, not of tunis. <END>
this tunis, sir, was carthage. <END>
carthage? <END>
i assure you, carthage. <END>
his word is more than the miraculous harp; he hath <END>
raised the wall and houses too. <END>
what impossible matter will he make easy next? <END>
i think he will carry this island home in his pocket <END>
and give it his son for an apple. <END>
and, sowing the kernels of it in the sea, bring <END>
forth more islands. <END>
ay. <END>
why, in good time. <END>
sir, we were talking that our garments seem now <END>
as fresh as when we were at tunis at the marriage <END>
of your daughter, who is now queen. <END>
and the rarest that e'er came there. <END>
bate, i beseech you, widow dido. <END>
o, widow dido! ay, widow dido. <END>
is not, sir, my doublet as fresh as the first day i <END>
wore it? i mean, in a sort. <END>
that sort was well fished for. <END>
when i wore it at your daughter's marriage? <END>
you cram these words into mine ears against <END>
the stomach of my sense. would i had never <END>
married my daughter there! for, coming thence, <END>
my son is lost and, in my rate, she too, <END>
who is so far from italy removed <END>
i ne'er again shall see her. o thou mine heir <END>
of naples and of milan, what strange fish <END>
hath made his meal on thee? <END>
sir, he may live: <END>
i saw him beat the surges under him, <END>
and ride upon their backs; he trod the water, <END>
whose enmity he flung aside, and breasted <END>
the surge most swoln that met him; his bold head <END>
'bove the contentious waves he kept, and oar'd <END>
himself with his good arms in lusty stroke <END>
to the shore, that o'er his wave-worn basis bow'd, <END>
as stooping to relieve him: i not doubt <END>
he came alive to land. <END>
no, no, he's gone. <END>
sir, you may thank yourself for this great loss, <END>
that would not bless our europe with your daughter, <END>
but rather lose her to an african; <END>
where she at least is banish'd from your eye, <END>
who hath cause to wet the grief on't. <END>
prithee, peace. <END>
you were kneel'd to and importuned otherwise <END>
by all of us, and the fair soul herself <END>
weigh'd between loathness and obedience, at <END>
which end o' the beam should bow. we have lost your <END>
son, <END>
i fear, for ever: milan and naples have <END>
more widows in them of this business' making <END>
than we bring men to comfort them: <END>
the fault's your own. <END>
so is the dear'st o' the loss. <END>
my lord sebastian, <END>
the truth you speak doth lack some gentleness <END>
and time to speak it in: you rub the sore, <END>
when you should bring the plaster. <END>
very well. <END>
and most chirurgeonly. <END>
it is foul weather in us all, good sir, <END>
when you are cloudy. <END>
foul weather? <END>
very foul. <END>
had i plantation of this isle, my lord,-- <END>
he'ld sow't with nettle-seed. <END>
or docks, or mallows. <END>
and were the king on't, what would i do? <END>
'scape being drunk for want of wine. <END>
i' the commonwealth i would by contraries <END>
execute all things; for no kind of traffic <END>
would i admit; no name of magistrate; <END>
letters should not be known; riches, poverty, <END>
and use of service, none; contract, succession, <END>
bourn, bound of land, tilth, vineyard, none; <END>
no use of metal, corn, or wine, or oil; <END>
no occupation; all men idle, all; <END>
and women too, but innocent and pure; <END>
no sovereignty;-- <END>
yet he would be king on't. <END>
the latter end of his commonwealth forgets the <END>
beginning. <END>
all things in common nature should produce <END>
without sweat or endeavour: treason, felony, <END>
sword, pike, knife, gun, or need of any engine, <END>
would i not have; but nature should bring forth, <END>
of its own kind, all foison, all abundance, <END>
to feed my innocent people. <END>
no marrying 'mong his subjects? <END>
none, man; all idle: whores and knaves. <END>
i would with such perfection govern, sir, <END>
to excel the golden age. <END>
god save his majesty! <END>
long live gonzalo! <END>
and,--do you mark me, sir? <END>
prithee, no more: thou dost talk nothing to me. <END>
i do well believe your highness; and <END>
did it to minister occasion to these gentlemen, <END>
who are of such sensible and nimble lungs that <END>
they always use to laugh at nothing. <END>
'twas you we laughed at. <END>
who in this kind of merry fooling am nothing <END>
to you: so you may continue and laugh at <END>
nothing still. <END>
what a blow was there given! <END>
an it had not fallen flat-long. <END>
you are gentlemen of brave metal; you would lift <END>
the moon out of her sphere, if she would continue <END>
in it five weeks without changing. <END>
we would so, and then go a bat-fowling. <END>
nay, good my lord, be not angry. <END>
no, i warrant you; i will not adventure <END>
my discretion so weakly. will you laugh <END>
me asleep, for i am very heavy? <END>
go sleep, and hear us. <END>
what, all so soon asleep! i wish mine eyes <END>
would, with themselves, shut up my thoughts: i find <END>
they are inclined to do so. <END>
please you, sir, <END>
do not omit the heavy offer of it: <END>
it seldom visits sorrow; when it doth, <END>
it is a comforter. <END>
we two, my lord, <END>
will guard your person while you take your rest, <END>
and watch your safety. <END>
thank you. wondrous heavy. <END>
what a strange drowsiness possesses them! <END>
it is the quality o' the climate. <END>
why <END>
doth it not then our eyelids sink? i find not <END>
myself disposed to sleep. <END>
nor i; my spirits are nimble. <END>
they fell together all, as by consent; <END>
they dropp'd, as by a thunder-stroke. what might, <END>
worthy sebastian? o, what might?--no more:-- <END>
and yet me thinks i see it in thy face, <END>
what thou shouldst be: the occasion speaks thee, and <END>
my strong imagination sees a crown <END>
dropping upon thy head. <END>
what, art thou waking? <END>
do you not hear me speak? <END>
i do; and surely <END>
it is a sleepy language and thou speak'st <END>
out of thy sleep. what is it thou didst say? <END>
this is a strange repose, to be asleep <END>
with eyes wide open; standing, speaking, moving, <END>
and yet so fast asleep. <END>
noble sebastian, <END>
thou let'st thy fortune sleep--die, rather; wink'st <END>
whiles thou art waking. <END>
